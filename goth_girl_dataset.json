{"prompt":"I Know We've All Heard it a Million Times, But I'm so Tired of Being Fetishized.","response":"**Preface**  \nI\u2019m by no means anti-sex. I\u2019m asexual, yeah\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m prudish or anti-kink. We all have our preferences, and I fully believe in embracing what makes you happy - as long as it doesn\u2019t hurt anyone and is fully consensual on behalf of both parties. You won\u2019t catch me kink-shaming. Unless it\u2019s this kind of thing. And before anyone jumps in - no, I\u2019m not here to shame individuals. That\u2019s not decent. I'll be omitting names and usernames out of respect. This is about *behavior*, not public stonings. I\u2019m sharing this because I know a lot of us - especially queer goths - have had similar run-ins. And honestly, I\u2019m just exhausted.\n\n(I was kind of unsure whether to put this in Seething Sunday or Experience. I think it could qualify for both. I do apologise in advance, this is a long post too.)\n\n**The Incident Itself:**\n\nSo the other night, I get a DM from a complete stranger. No posts, no comments, zero interaction with me anywhere before this. Their profile is marked 18+ (glaringly, might I add), and the message they send?\n\nThem - \"It's okay if you don't feel like a man you know. If you're more feminine that's okay. You know You aren't messed up.\"\n\nMe - \"Thank you, means a lot. I guess I am on the feminine side, but I don't think I'm trans or anything (nothing wrong with that, I just don't think I am). Just how it is for some, how we like it.\"\n\nThem - \"That's okay Nothing wrong being fem and sissy. It's okay to explore it. If you're a good girl and a princess that's okay. I promise. Or if you want to be a goddess be a goddess. Which one sounds better in your head.\"\n\nMe - \"Fem, I suppose. If I had to choose. Never really thought about labelling it beyond perhaps sensitive.\" (I did not mean to open any gates here. Was still trying to be nice and gently deter him. Should not have said this)\n\nThem - \"That's okay. You're a girl then. And I'll respect that. A goth goddess. That is pretty cool.\"\n\n...oh no.\n\nThem - \"I know so. I bet you'll look amazing in fem goth clothes. It'll get better.\"\n\nMe (losing patience, tired, it's 3am) - \"Oh? You bet? You bet? Based on what? The astral projection of your own horniness?\"\n\nThem - \"Hell yeah. I got a good lunch. \\*Hunch.\"\n\nMe- \"You typo'd your own creepy declaration and then corrected it like that helped. No it did not help. Now you just look like a pervert and a buffoon. Why are you here?\"\n\n...they've not replied since. From what I can tell, they found me through a *mental health* support thread. I\u2019d made a vulnerable post, mentioned I was goth somewhere in there, and apparently that was enough to make me fantasy fodder. Not a person. Not a guy. Just \"goth\". That was the whole attraction, and somehow that was supposed to flatter me?\n\nFor context\u2014I\u2019m a cis man. Though I'm someone who quite openly opposes gender norms, quite intentionally seeking to have a more androgynous look because that's what I look like and have a preference for. (Not in a sexual way at all, there's nothing suggestive about how I dress and I've never posted a picture of myself on here) and I\u2019m queer. But I made it clear - **twice -** in that original post that I\u2019m a guy and biologically male. It\u2019s not hard to read. And even if I *was* trans (which I\u2019m not), you\u2019d think the bare minimum of decency would be to respect someone\u2019s identity, yeah?\n\nBut no. He decided \u201cgoth\u201d was his fetish, and I was going to be his little project. Or conquest. Or... whatever gross fantasy he thought he was entitled to. He even completely ignored the fact I mentioned I have a *partner*. Just barreled straight through that detail like it didn\u2019t matter because, again, I wasn\u2019t a *person* to him. Just an image.\n\nAnd honestly? I'm so tired of it.\n\nI'm socially awkward, and I really did try to be nice and refuse him gently, but I don't think I did. I think in tiredness and just general annoyance I was kind of mean. It's kind of left me feeling frazzled and guilty, and sort of just unsure of how to feel. (This is the first time I've ever been creeped on in private and not in person)\n\nI know this isn\u2019t a unique experience - especially in alternative scenes. We get sexualized, mystified, dehumanized, and it\u2019s all shrugged off like it's a compliment. It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s violating. And I\u2019m done pretending it\u2019s flattering when it\u2019s actually just creepy.\n\nI love being goth. I love the freedom it brings. The beauty. The music. The weirdness. The expressiveness. But I hate how many people think it's a green light to strip away your boundaries just because you wear eyeliner and black, and like a certain type of music.\n\nAnyway, thanks for letting me rant. I\u2019d love to hear how others deal with this kind of attention, or if you've ever had to shut down a creep in your DMs too.\n\nI'm unsure of how to end this, as a *wonderful* first post to make here...sorry.\n\nYou deserve to be seen as a *person*, not a prop."}

{"prompt":"Return To Recinder - blood.twin","response":"*NEW SINGLE*\n\nRETURN TO RECINDER\nby blood.twin\n\nOUT NOW!\n\n\ud81a\udd10\ud81a\udd10\ud81a\udd10\ud81a\udd10 (3.9 stars) \u2014 DarkScene.org\n\nDOWNLOAD NOW ON Bandcamp\nbloodtwin.bandcamp.com\n\nAND STREAMING EVERYWHERE!\n\n\"The best blood.twin release yet - dark swirling sounds, powerful and unexpected vocal delivery. Taking it to a new level. Amazing!\"\n\u2014 Andrew Barnes, DarkScene.org\n\nblood.twin's new single, 'Return To Recinder', is an uncompromising auditory assault, mirrored in its haunting, fragmented cover art, the track charts a harrowing descent into technological decay and personal annihilation. The song plunges the listener into a digital purgatory of flickering screens and failing signals, where lyrics \u2014 visually echoed by spectral afterimages and black-stained tears \u2014 paint a cold, stark world of cyclical self-destruction, spectral alienation and the brutalist architecture of a personal collapse. \u2014 A stark world where human connection is a distorted, lost transmission and the only escape is a final, ritualistic return to ash.\n\nMusically, the track forges a brutal fusion of Industrial, Martial EBM and Coldwave, while retaining the wailing gothic guitars of blood.twin's Darkwave roots! Driven by a relentless, distorted EBM beat and icy synth lines, the song's core is its confrontational vocal delivery. Detached, despairing verses give way to a chorus of extremely loud, shouted drill sargent-like commands, turning the act of destruction into a cold, disciplined protocol.\n\n'Return To Recinder' is a definitive statement piece, poised to resonate with listeners who appreciate a harsher, more confrontational and rhythmic electronic sound. It is a soundtrack for a system collapse\u2014both digital and human\u2014and an unflinching invitation to witness a controlled demolition of the self.\n\nFor lovers of: Front 242, Nitzer Ebb, Ministry, Laibach, Skinny Puppy, KMFDM, Cold Cave, The Soft Moon, Boy Harsher, Bauhaus, Red Lorry Yellow Lorry, Play Dead and the dystopian atmospheres of Blade Runner, Tetsuo: The Iron Man and William Gibson.\n\nDEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF DJ KEVIN \"LOKI\" GLADWELL R.I.P.\n\n#goth #gothmusic #EBM #industrialmusic #idustrialmusicforindustrialpeople #industrialrock  #gothindustrial #gothic #gothicmusic #gothicrock #tradgoth #deathrock #electrogoth #synth #SynthGoth #electro #electromusic #electronicmusic #darksynth #darkwave #darkwavemusic #coldwave #coldwavemusic #postpunk #postpunkmusic #martialebm #darkelectro #electroindustrial #darkelectronic #darkelectronicmusic"}

I'm just curious as someone finally deep diving into more traditional goth music, if any artists that make goth music have ever embraced the label and called themselves goth. \n\nI used to call everything dark \"goth\" growing up but I'm trying to educate myself more on the actual goth genre and this is a bit I am curious about at the moment!"}
{"prompt":"Have any artists embraced the goth label?","response":"Fields of the Nephilim, maybe. In 2012 one of their leads said they were fine with being called Goth. Though I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019ve fully embraced the label\n\nThe Mission, an offshoot of Sisters of Mercy also grew to accept being called goth, but I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019ve embraced the label either"}
{"prompt":"Have any artists embraced the goth label?","response":"this cold night has a song called eighties goth suicide note which I think is them embracing the label"}
{"prompt":"Have any artists embraced the goth label?","response":"We have. When we we originally making music as Vandal Moon, we were going for a sort of dark psychedelic electronic sound, but found ourselves embraced by the culture. We wear the label proudly, even if we don't fit into it like a puzzle piece."}
{"prompt":"Have any artists embraced the goth label?","response":"Pretty much every goth band on Bandcamp uses the 'goth' tag. (Unfortunately many non-goth bands do as well, but that's a different story.)"}
{"prompt":"What would you classify as \u201cgoth music\u201d and what makes modern goth a music based sub culture?","response":"I have gained a fairly new interest in the goth subculture and this has been a topic that has confused me a fair bit. \n\nWhen i first learned about goth i thought it was a purely\/mostly aesthetic, value and ideal based sub culture. Finding out it had to do with music i assumed it would be either something like classical music or something like heavy metal but that was also wrong.\n\nI now know about Gothic-rock and that it was the base for the birth of goth subculture but (and this is from the view of someone who don\u2019t know where to find it so i could be wrong) it seems very finite with not many songs and bands making it during the 2010s\n\nDespite this the sub culture seems to be thriving and becoming more popular in the mainstream with ppl who identify themselves as goth. Especially on a variety of influencer sites (such as tik tok and instagram)\n\nSo I\u2019m wondering if the definition is changing from a purely music based sub culture to something with a more diverse definition or if there are more forms of music that i might not be aware of that would classify as goth music? \n\nPlease keep in mind that this question is coming from an outsider of the culture, I\u2019m just someone who has gained an interest in the subculture and wanna learn more about it and what it is\/was\/is becoming \n\n\n\nEDIT: Thank everyone for the nice and helpful comments, i feel like i have gained a better understanding of what Goth is as well as some genres i didn't know about with music that i really like the vibe\/sound of. the comments and music suggestions have given me a larger intrest in the music as well so thank everyone for that :D"}

{"prompt":"Meeting new people in the Goth subculture","response":"Hey all, I've been pondering a few questions for a while and I thought that the best place to ask would be here.\n\nI only got into the subculture a few months ago and I find myself stuck on how to meet new people within the community, especially within my area. I live over an hour away from my nearest metropolitan area, and I feel a bit isolated as a newbie. The area I'm in doesn't seem to have much of a gothic or alt community in general as far as I'm able to research, and it leaves me with the only option being events in the nearest cities, which I can't always attend as a result of work commitments.\n\nOverall though, when I can I would like to go to some events, as I enjoy live music. As of yet, I haven't attended any goth events though. I am a rather shy person, and I lack a bit of confidence in regard to introducing myself to new people, or even being in larger crowds. For me, its a weird position of either flying solo for a bit until I happen to meet others, or being a bit more proactive and putting myself in situations where I can meet other people, regardless of it being in my local area or not.\n\nWith all of that said, the main two questions I have are these:\n\n* How would I go about finding some alt or goth people in my local area?\n* and if I were to attend events in the city, how would I best make some friends while by myself?\n\nThank you."}

{"prompt":"Why do some goth figures turn into establishment shills over time","response":"I was thinking about how some alt figures turn into establishment shills over time, or even the history of the pathetic fascists calling themselves punk or goth. If anyone has any resources on this topic, PLEASE I NEED YOUR HELP!\nMy guess so far is that movements like these are ripe for posers, Yknow how anti capitalist movements are hijacked by the establishment as a means to cheapen its message and all we are left with in the end is a commodified husk of aesthetics.

It would be amazing!\nWhat I mean by resources is\u2014info about the figures who have done this grift in the past, any books, articles anything"}
{"prompt":"Why do some goth figures turn into establishment shills over time","response":"Honestly, a lot of those people had a shallow understanding of politics to begin with, and as dismissive as this sounds, being alternative is a very privileged form of \u201crebellion\u201d."}

When people would link other posts about this, all the posts I saw were from YEARS (plural) ago, and honestly, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll stop talking about this until I see people recognizing it for what it is.

No. But I do think some people could do better. So please, don\u2019t be rude about this post, but just recognize it as a real common issue.

{"prompt":"Extreme manipulative MMC \/ Dependent FMC","response":"Someone asked for a dark stepbrother rec, and another commenter suggested[ Imperium by Moonlightdreams234](https:\/\/archiveofourown.org\/works\/63198178\/chapters\/161863609?view_adult=true). It\u2019s still ongoing, but from what I\u2019ve read so far, it gives strong {Little Stranger by Leigh Rivers} and {Never Far by A.A. Dark} vibes. I\u2019m really enjoying it.\n\nWhat I enjoy about this story:\n\n1. **The Emotional Intensity and Psychological Depth** I\u2019m drawn to stories that dive deep into unhealthy, obsessive relationships where love, control, and trauma blur together. I like dark romances that focus on emotional dependence and psychological control rather than just surface-level smut or typical romance tropes. This story nails that with Aleksander\u2019s manipulative, dominating presence and Ella\u2019s vulnerable, conflicted state. The tension, fear, and twisted loyalty feel raw and authentic.\n2. **Complex, Flawed Characters with Dark Pasts and Motivations** I\u2019m attracted to characters who aren\u2019t purely good or evil but exist in shades of grey, like Aleksander\u2019s mix of cruelty, possessiveness, and hidden vulnerability, and Ella\u2019s naivety combined with growing self-awareness. I appreciate how the story slowly unravels their motivations, showing how emotional dependence forms, instead of offering idealized or romanticized \u201cbad boys.\u201d\n3. **The Power Imbalance and Psychological Manipulation** I find the way Aleksander exerts control over Ella, not just physically but mentally and emotionally, compelling. The suffocating atmosphere created by this manipulation really draws me in. I\u2019m interested in stories where this control isn\u2019t glossed over but is central, revealing the dangerous dynamics of obsession and power.\n\nI\u2019m looking for similar recommendations where the MMC almost consumes the FMC, like {Limerence by H.C.

Better if the scene is from the MMC\u2019s POV so we get to witness all the inner turmoil he\u2019s going through.\n\n\n\nMild spoilers ahead, even if they\u2019re not really plot-related:\n\n* In {His Pretty Little Burden by Nicci Harris}, if I remember right, the MMC catches the FMC trying to touch herself and realizes she\u2019s never done it before so he talks her through it.\n* A bit different, but in {Follow by Tessa Bailey}, the FMC refuses the MMC\u2019s invitation to his hotel room next to hers. Aware of the sexual tension, he challenges her to take her masturbation session out to the balcony so he can at least hear her. They end up both masturbating on opposite sides of the balcony divider while dirty talking.\n* I can\u2019t remember which book had this exact scene: the FMC starts touching herself in her bedroom, the MMC watches through hidden cameras he planted earlier. After a while, he can\u2019t take it anymore and barges into her room, sits down on a chair, and watches her, without ever touching her, then just leaves. I thought it was in Lights Out, but I checked and he does touch her in that one, so either I made this scene up entirely or it\u2019s from a completely different book.\n\n  \nAny other recs in mind ?"}

I have searched and searched - google, tags, and nothing. I believe it was a second part.\n\nSo here's the gist. A woman lost a poker game against a vampire who can read minds (she obvi didn't know what he was at the time). Because she didn't have any money to pay after she lost, she agreed to spend a night with him, but she could tell he was other-worldly. She was reluctant to go to a strangers house but she went anyway. I remember when she got there, he made her a drink and asked her to reapply her red lipstick. I vividly remember that he took her to the bedroom and told her to pick a collar out of the dresser. She picked out the leather one because it looked softer and worn in compared to the other metal ones. He took blood from her and mixed it in with his whiskey and disclosed what he was and that he could read her mind. After that things start to get hazy in my memory.  After everything was over, she bathed in his huge bathtub and he have her the money from the poker game (because technically he cheated since he could read her mind) and then she left.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s been deleted or moved to publish but I can\u2019t remember any of the character names or the title for the life of me."}

{"prompt":"Vampire Short Story on Literotica - PLEASE HELP ME FIND","response":"I am hoping that there will someone who can help me find this short story I read on Literotica a few years ago. I have been looking ever since I read it and forgot to write the title or the author down.\n\nThe story was well written, and had elements of bondage and some reluctance in it.\n\nSo here's the gist. A woman lost a poker game against a vampire who can read minds (she obvi didn't know what he was at the time). Because she didn't have any money to pay after she lost, she agreed to spend a night with him, but she could tell he was other-worldly. She was reluctant to go to a strangers house but she went anyway. I remember when she got there, he made her a drink and asked her to reapply her red lipstick. I vividly remember that he took her to the bedroom and told her to pick a collar out of the dresser. She picked out the leather one because it looked softer and worn in compared to the other metal ones. He took blood from her and mixed it in with his whiskey and disclosed what he was and that he could read her mind. After that things start to get hazy in my memory. She went down on him in his chair in front of the fire. Then he chained her to the floor via the collar. I remember there was an plug and he had did the deed with her. His man servant came back at some point and told her that the vampire must really like her since he stretched her out before the deed. After everything was over, she bather in his huge bathtub and he have her the money from the poker game (because technically he cheated since he could read her mind) and then she left.\n\nPlease help me find this story! Thank you!"}

{"prompt":"{The Scholomance by R. Lee Smith} Book Review","response":"R. Lee Smith did it again. Hooked me into a disturbing story which I could not put down despite the horrors she presents to us with excruciating detail. This was a bit full on so enter with caution! The Scholomance features our FMC Mara who is arguably going to be the most detestable FMC you have ever had the joy of reading.\u00a0\n\nThe novel begins with an introduction to our emotionless FMC Mara, who has received a letter in the mail from her best friend that went missing two years ago. It doesn\u2019t say much, but it\u2019s enough for Mara to drop everything and to fly to Eastern Europe in search of the Scholomance. Her knowledge of the school is limited to the ramblings of her missing friend, but she does know that it is probable upon entry into the Scholomance, she will not escape, as legend has it that the devil takes one of every ten students admitted into the hellish school.\u00a0\n\nThis brutal school will set your teeth on edge. Every part of the Scholomance is deadly and Mara\u2019s arrogance knows no bounds. I loved it. It made me feel uncomfortable the majority of the time, and angry the rest of the time. Why would you want to read something like that you ask? Because if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll want to find out what happened to Mara\u2019s best friend, Connie. The mystery gripped me. Mara\u2019s relationship with the characters she meets had me shook.\n\nI\u2019ve got to say, the ending of this novel was phenomenal. It was surprising in many ways. I won\u2019t spoil a thing but my advice would be to persist, to not give up, just like Mara never gives up her search of her bestie.\u00a0\n\nLove, R&R\n\n* Demon academy\u00a0\n* Dark romance\n* SA (trigger warning)\n* Horror\n* \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\/5"}

He enters her dreams or makes her believe she is dreaming and I think he makes her have orgasms. \n\nI don't remember anything else because I didn't finish reading it, it was too +18 for me and I didn't feel comfortable with the descriptions.

They make her life hell.\nShe\u2019s shy, quiet, pure, and self-conscious, especially about her body. A total wallflower. No backbone. No sass. Just silent, internal pain.\nShe\u2019s a virgin, never been touched or loved. And he knows it.\nThe bullying is intense \u2014 think locker sabotage, public humiliation, degrading comments.

She\u2019s utterly alone.\n\n\n\ud83d\udc94 The Bet \/ Betrayal: ( no compulsion for this to be included but would this trope too)\n\nThere\u2019s a bet or dare involved: the hero has to make her fall for him, maybe even get her to sleep with him.\nHe pretends to like her, shows her the tiniest crumbs of kindness, and she falls hard because she\u2019s desperate for love.\nWhen she finally gives in (emotionally and physically)\u2026 she finds out it was all a lie.

Hard. I want guilt. Regret. Full-on obsession.

The darkness, oh the darkness\u2026**  \n  \nI have read The Last Hour of Gann, Land of the Beautiful Dead, Heat, Cottonwood and now The Scholomance and they all reached into my irregularly beating heart and *squeezed*.  \nReading her books leaves me squashed out mentally, joyfully crushed by the romping roller coaster of it all.\n\nThe first clue we get that the FMC of The Scholomance is not your normal nice heroine comes early on when >!Mara shoves herself into her mother\u2019s head in order to find out about the \u201cletter from her little friend\u201d. Then we get to know more and more and when Mara climbs into Mr Murder\u2019s tent!< and we find out what happens therein we realize that this is indeed no ordinary FMC.\n\nThe Scholomance is in some ways the dream about being a >!superhero - about being powerful, smart and lusciously beautiful. Of being the one that everyone craves, as well as being able to protect yourself from harm. Of being in control.!<\n\nAlas we also learn about what being able to >!read the thoughts of others can do to you. I can imagine the effect it would have upon a child, always being aware of what mummy and daddy thinks. Always getting the, sometimes very dark, truth. Always knowing the small and big lies that people tell, well meaning or not. From a young age hearing every lascivious and breathless speculation about her body. Of course she could not have a \u201chealthy\u201d view of humanity or of sex really for that matter.!<\n\nBut the thing about the writing of R Lee Smith that I adore the most is her superb touch when it comes to creating the villain and\/or the anti-hero. She makes them unfurl and breathe and even at their worst you have extremely strong feelings about them that are not always negative. You live with them, white-knuckled and breathless and anticipating, always anticipating...\n\nAnd, oh, there will be villains and anti-heroes in this book. Oh yes, there will.\n\nFirst we have >!Horuseps - gorgeous elegant Horuseps of the creamy moonlit glassy upper body and dark plated chitinous armored nether parts with his ovoid black sclera eyes filled with moving lights and long arms ending in black hands comfortably resting on his shoulders. Tall and androgynous. Angelic, clever, soft spoken and smiling Horuseps with his disturbing touch of a thousand scuttling centipedes and his unpleasant hissing laugh like millions of beetles taking flight. How his head tends to tip, regarding his prey like a bird from an angle, his hair moving, rippling as from a breeze without any wind. The lights in his eyes sparking and fading like fireflies, like a galaxy. His mind strange. His movements full of grace, gliding like ripples over tar with the lower part of his body often almost invisible in the darkness of the cave\u2019s corridors. His slick and oilsome manners which can sometimes be disturbingly sincere. I enjoy the silent occasions between Horuseps and Mara - when he kneels before her and cares for her feet. When they have their little moments playing with each other. His covetous perilous thoughts about her, the fact that he finds her\u2026 precious. Who wouldn\u2019t want to be precious to Horuseps? Handsome beautiful Horuseps, who has been called both alien and angel.!<\n\nAnd then, >!Kazuul -a name which I first found absurd, but it grew on me and in the end I could not accept any other name. He was Kazuul, terrible and awe-inspiring, tall and muscular, horned and clawed (there is something about MMCs with claws!) with glowing green eyes and spikes jutting out from his large delectable body. His speech ancient and purring, his voice deep, rolling and entrancing. His breath animalistically hot. His mind dark and fortified even against Mara. A true telepath. Wearing a complicated loincloth (oh how I adore loincloths on men) baring most of his powerful body.!<\n\nThe word \u201cdisrobe\u201d has found a new meaning inside me.\n\nAnd, oh how I enjoyed hating >!Malavan with his poor hareem (his Pretty One, his Sleeper, his Song Bird and his Little Laugh \u2013 worst of all Little Laugh, whose screaming giggles were born out of some shred of mad awareness) and his threats, his feelings of belittlement, the very true derisiveness with which the other, higher caste, demons see him. Their cold and smirking contempt making him fume and take it out on his students. The scene with the walnut in Malavan\u2019s theater - amazing (the hissing furious cloud of new leaves. The green stink of it)! His fondness for human feet - wonderful.!<\n\nAnd poor >!Devlin (or Astregon:)), the hornless young excitable goat (well, sometimes the surly goat, and not quite so young anymore) with his self-conscious turtling up and inability to take a hint. Devlin with his ill-advised bunny tattoo and other, just as ill-advised, life choices. Devlin of the too big floppy sandals and millenium \u201cit seemed like a good idea at the time\u201d thing. Devlin shaking Mara\u2019s sleeve for attention just like a toddler with his preoccupied mother. The gazelle among hungry lions. His story is a sad one and he gives a face to all those other unfortunate faceless gazelles in the crowd. It\u2019s heartbreaking when he tells Mara \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like here\u2026 how it gets\u2026 when there\u2019s nothing else for them (meaning the lions) to do but\u2026 eat you\u201d.!<\n\nAnd >!Connie, always Connie, so much *there* in her absence. Always beyond reach. Mara\u2019s only real friend. Bumbling and inadequate and just\u2026 nice. \u201cI wish I had what you had\u201d she says to Mara in Mara\u2019s dreams. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like you think it is. It\u2019s no fun at all\u201d Mara wishes she had told her when they were kids. The locket that Connie once gave to Mara serving as her avatar, something to be cherished and protected. And we first get a taste of Mara\u2019s indomitable will when Horuseps tries to take it off her.!<\n\nAnd most of all the humanity, Homo Sapiens, and what we can do to each other. What can evolve in a group. The gazelles and the lions. It is not a beautiful picture that R Lee Smith paints. >!Le Danse and his giggling henchman Loki, the races - the awful races\u2026!<\n\nThis book has many scenes with blood splatter and frightful gore, but the thing that moves one the most is the underlying cruelty and indifference. It is extremely well written. This book breathes and it grips you, shakes you and brings you into it.\n\nAnd R Lee Smith makes the Scholomance, >!the cave system, itself, a big part of the story. How the stone walls make the Mindstorm quiet for Mara and how the demons have constructed it to be acoustically minimized in some places while acoustically maximized in the dining hall in order to influence the human students within. The serene terror of the harrowing under the Scrivener\u2019s many unseeing eyes and absently information-filled screaming mind in the library. The dreadful flickering light bulbs in the corridors. The things moving in the room under the lavatories. Details like the carvings on the doors to the demons\u2019 theaters, and especially Kazuul\u2019s.!<\n\nI enjoy how R Lee Smith describes >!Mara\u2019s cozily controlled Panic Room with it\u2019s monitors showing what is going on outside her eyes, how her body is spatially positioned and how her dreams play out as well as the meters for health\/bodily functions and the windows of the Panic Room showing the raging Mindstorm outside it. I liked the descriptions of how the Panic Room evolved, how at first Mara had to watch her dreams on the dream screen in order to feel fully rested the next day and how she at first had a chair but now no longer needed it, being able to just hover in the air. And this part also speaks to Mara\u2019s control, the fact that she can be aware of her surroundings even when she sleeps and how this kind of control can affect a person. Just being able to shut yourself away in a Panic Room and flee pain or just the feeling of being physically uncomfortable\u2026 how must it affect the person one becomes to have this paranoid place of refuge, this comfortable overcoat to shrug into. One wonders how it all seems in Mara\u2019s world. And the fact that Mara again and again comes back to the thought that whatever she is, she is not a killer.!<\n\nR Lee Smith's books have taught me that the bigger and more monstrous the monster is the more I want it, so if you have some recommendations for me of darker than dark books with big bad monster MMCs (and please let them be tall! Irredeemable height size queen - that's me. I am aware that this is not very nice, but it exists deeply inside me) please let me know.  \n  \nAlso, how do you feel about The Scholomance and the characters of R Lee Smith? Which is her best book?\n\nI found many interesting >!demons in the caves of The Scholomance...!< Who are you more attracted to - >!Horuseps or Kazuul?!< Let's discuss:)  \n\n\nWarning: The work of R Lee Smith is truly dark with a LOT of triggers."}

The darker the better \ud83d\ude08\n\nThe book that triggered this craving is {Lawless Games, Olivia Yabsley} which wasn't really good but made me want more of this trope.\n\n{Pageant,  Lilith Vincent} has a similar situation but it's barely mentioned in the book, I want moooooooore\n\nOne of the Made series kinda has this too if I recall correctly, I may be confusing it with the Sinners anonymous series because  I tend to mix them up but I already read both anyway."}

{"prompt":"Power Couples \/ Role reversal","response":"I'm not sure if these even both exist in the same book but looking for this type of dynamic. Where the FMC is just as powerful or more so than the MMC. And once together, they become a power couple. I've been in my mafia romance era lately and while I've enjoyed it, I keep hoping for stronger FMCs. Most mafia romances have the MMC way more powerful in all aspects. And, yes, some mafia romances have the FMC as \"stubborn or sassy or bold\" but they hold no real position of power.\n\nEven better if both MCs hold high positions and are pitted against each other for whatever reason. Power play trope, for the win! \n\nI'm good with all genres. Only trigger I tend to avoid is non-con between the main couple. Dub-con is okay."}

(Little Bird Lost)","response":"I just finished the dark romance book Little Bird Lost\u2026it was sensational, morally black, and AMAZING\u2026.but apparently the author promised a sequel that has been pending publish for 2+ years? My research tells me Jessie Walker is writing\/planning to release other novels this year, but no news on a sequel to Little Bird Lost. Does anyone have any info on why there hasn\u2019t been a publishing yet? The author seems to have kind of faded into the mist. \n\nSide note: Firstly, READ THE TRIGGER WARNING of this book. Second, Jessie Walker writes Little Bird Lost SO BEAUTIFULLY. Incredibly enveloping writing. It is DAAAARK. Black even at times. It can \u201cbe read as a standalone\u201d, per the author. It is reverse harem, but also includes MF, MM, MFM, and FMMM romance. There isn\u2019t a TON of spice, but the spice that is written is very well placed, well written, and MEANINGFUL. There\u2019s at least one spice sesh that lasts 40 pages and it\u2019s totally worth it. THE PLOT BE PLOTTING! This book is 700+ pages and doesn\u2019t leave you wanting.

{"prompt":"bc tampering\/breeding request","response":"Possession by BJ Alpha was recommended here for the birth control tampering \/ breeding trope. The book description was right up my alley. Mafia, possessive, OTT MMC.\n\nI started reading it and I actually liked the author\u2019s writing style. The MMC was super possessive and very over-the-top, which is always a win for me.\n\nBut I had to DNF. The FMC is 18 and still taking high school courses even though she technically finished high school. The MMC is 32. I can usually overlook an age gap of 15 years but when she\u2019s barely legal? I can\u2019t. Which sucks cuz the book gets good spicy fast and the spice is \ud83e\udd75\n\nAlso the way the author kept describing her body\u2026 she basically had no shape, like a child\u2019s body. And the MMC constantly calls her \u201chis little doll\u201d and makes references about \u201cbreaking her\u201d. I tried to push through and make her older in my head but I couldn\u2019t when the book is heavy with ddlg language. \n\nAnyway, any good spicy requests for books with bc tampering\/breeding??\n\nI would prefer mafia, no reverse harem, no cheating. I read all the books by SJ Tilly and Lilith Vincent. No reqs for Sam Mariano, Rina Kent, Shantel Tessier, please. Looking for FMCs that are at least 21 and over."}

{"prompt":"I can\u2019t remember the name","response":"Solved: Mafia King of lies- Kayla Mason\n\nMafia romance. Age gap. MMC sees FMC at her brothers funeral. He knows the dad and I think he tried to arrange a marriage for the fmc and his son, but mmc ends up claiming her for himself. He\u2019s a widower. The son slowly starts to distance himself and challenge his dad. There is a cliffhanger where the \u201cdead\u201d wife comes back and the book ends on \u201chi. I\u2019m Mrs._____\u201d I cant remember the last name. And I believe fmc is pregnant. \n\nEnds in cliffhanger with no information on when the next part comes out."}

{"prompt":"Do you judge a DR by its cover ?","response":"I'm having a hard time taking a book seriously if I find the cover repelling or cringe. For example, half-naked men on the cover is a no-no for me (and unfortunately, that seems to be the default for a LOOOOT of DR). Other cover styles I can't take seriously include weird font choices or those \u201ccute\u201d designs that don\u2019t scream dark romance at all, like *The Twisted Series* by Ana Huang.\n\nI just got recommended {The Boy & His Ribbon by Pepper Winters}. I have no idea what it\u2019s about, but my brain cannot fathom it being anything other than a story about a little boy and his reindeer walking alone in Lapland.\n\nThe issue is, when I don't like the cover I don't pick them when I have to choose a new book. I often have to pep-talk myself into giving certain books a chance, even though I end up actually enjoying them. For example, I recently read {Plaything by Beanie Harper}, and the cover screams \"made with Microsoft Word 2011.\" I needed a *lot* of convincing to pick it up, but it turned out to be a really fun read.\n\nAlternative question, what's the ***worst*** cover you\u2019ve ever stumbled upon? I think mine is {Morning Glory Milking Farm by C.M. Nascosta} but I'm not into monster romances so maybe I just don't see the appeal..."}
{"prompt":"Do you judge a DR by its cover ?","response":"I try not to but it\u2019s sooo hard. I hate covers with models or cartoon-like illustrations.\n\n{pen pal by j.t. Geissinger} is probably the best example I can think of\u2026model on the cover. You think this is going to be a pure smut book and it does an absolute disservice to how good the book is!"}
{"prompt":"Do you judge a DR by its cover ?","response":"The cover has absolutely no relevance on what I choose to read. Some of the best books I\u2019ve read have awful covers."}
{"prompt":"Do you judge a DR by its cover ?","response":"Cartoon covers really, really put me off. It\u2019s stopped me buying sets before. I\u2019ll read the book on kindle but I won\u2019t buy the book. I\u2019ve made my peace with the men on the covers. It literally can\u2019t be avoided. I don\u2019t like it, but at least a lot of authors offer discrete books."}

It also sheds new light on what happened with Eddie Reyes, including how his ownership stake was redistributed. A lot of the fan speculation over the years actually lines up with what\u2019s in here. It\u2019s also been filed as a demand for jury trial. \n\nHonestly, it makes a lot more sense now why the band has stayed completely silent about Mark\u2019s departure.\n\nI\u2019m attaching the full document here for anyone who wants to read through it:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/scl\/fi\/g9y0yi7vo26nlzqoo1iig\/608189_2025_Mark_O_Connell_v_Taking_Back_Sunday_Inc_et_al_COMPLAINT__AMENDED__2.pdf?rlkey=r5hsy94grkhdq7gy6nhb728h5&st=3bbgs810&dl=0\n\nCurious to hear what everyone else thinks?!"}

Such a killer drum groove with the radio filter, and when the rest of the band kicks in it sounds fucking amazing. The first time I heard that song, I knew I would be hooked to the entire record.\n\n I think it really showcases Braid's musicianship too, which is an aspect of 2nd wave emo that I love.

The way they blended twinkly guitar stuff with jazzy time signatures and those saxophone lines... it just hit different. Like, it was emotional without being overly dramatic. Everything felt locked in, but also kind of unhinged in a really good way.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of wild that they only ever dropped that one record and dipped. No follow-up, no scattered b-sides, nothing. Just that one perfect thing. And yeah, I get that they\u2019ve all moved on with their lives \u2014 jobs, other projects, etc. \u2014 but I feel like there's still a lot of quiet love out there for that band.\n\nWould genuinely love to see them do something, even if it\u2019s just a one-off hometown show or reissue with some live demos.

It is my birthday tomorrow and I\u2019m manifesting the most special, rare, generous and precious love. One where a beautiful woman is proud to have me, shows me off, romanticizes my effort and love, one where I grow and am allowed to access all the soft\/gentle\/vulnerable parts of myself and pulls me in closer. I want it all.. I want the cute pictures, the love notes\/letters, the songs that remind her of me, the physical touch, the random looks where I can see in her eyes how much she loves me, her protection, & affection. I want the intimacy. I wish to find a lover that helps me grow and loves me through all my stages and supports me. I\u2019ve seen people enter good relationships and start to glow because they\u2019re being loved the right way. I wish to find that love for myself. I wish to dispel and no longer attract beings\/relationships that feel like they take more from me than give, or that leave me feeling parched, empty or questioning the love. That leave me feeling sad or asking if I\u2019m unworthy of the love I feel I deserve. If the love I feel like I deserve just simply doesn\u2019t exist.

{"prompt":"How do I move on from someone who is my whole life?","response":"Hi! I have the canon gay girl problem of being in love with the straight best friend. She is my absolute best friend, I love her to death, we joke that we're married, and I told her one time a year ago about my feelings, but I worded it like I was over it (spoiler: I'm not). I'm yearning and pining and absolutely longing for this wonderful amazing girl I can never have, and it is awful and so hard because she's my first love, and it feels like I won't get over it to the point where it could be my only love. It's so horribly painful to deal with, and I don't want to enter a relationship while I'm hung up on a girl I can never have, but I don't know how to not be hung up on her.

{"prompt":"I Met my boyfriend only because I am a massive Nerd","response":"I joined a science club\/ open lab at my school. Originally just planned to make some sketches for a bigger project, but I stayed. The next year some students a grade above me joined. The club became a real safe space for me. One of the guys was my neighbour ( his cat got 3 generations of my besties cats pregnant so I had a little resentment against him, that\u2019s a different story though ). He brought a friend with him, he later became my boy friend. Our first date was a experiment with cheap roses and xylitol to see how long plant vacuoles can hold their pressure when infused with different kinds of nutrients aka how long flower pretty if we put stuff in water. We joined a science competition and won 3thrd place so that\u2019s a win :) He insisted we only made it so far because I had a natural talent for explaining and convincing. We spent almost every weekend and some weekdays at his house planning our experiments and writing protocols for that competition. We got really close and started meeting outside that whole science stuff. I made the first move because he was so shy, I thought that was really cute. My friends one town over think he is cool and they became friends too. I\u2019m just so happy it worked out like that :)"}

{"prompt":"I don't know what to expect.","response":"I got divorced recently. And start seeing my previous ex (the girl I dated for 5 years before I got married to my current ex wife). This girl is my person, my place to always return. However, she has a couple, the same soab she started dating after we broke up. \nShe enjoys being with me though, and I can notice it. She calls me when he isn't around, and tells me she misses me, and that she never stopped thinking of me, just lime it happened to me too. \nIt's fucked up cause I know what I got into, but I think of her all day and want to be with her.\nOur love was real and still feels the same. Strong connection and complicity, same desire.\n\nBut I don't know if this would lead us to being back together at some point. She is generally a great person, and I know she wouldn't do this with anyone else that's not me.\n\nMy head is a mess. I know I should feel bad for the other dude but honestly IDGAF.\n\nThis shit's gonna hurt."}

{"prompt":"I think I'm falling in love with my best friend.","response":"Well, hi! \n\nEnglish isn't my first language, so I apologize in advance. But I needed to vent a little.\n\nI think this is the wrong flair, but I don't know which one to put, and I'm just too confused by everything to think straight, sorry.\n\nI'm still a teenager (non-binary, I use male pronouns), a neurodivergent teenager who is trying to understand the world as best I can with not very liberal parents. And well, I have a trio of friends, and one of my friends is a boy. I've known him for six years, almost seven (I've only known my friend who is a girl for a year less), and I've always felt a little like that.\n\nWhen we were younger, and we were in the Middle School, 5th Grade, he confessed to me. Like, he really confessed to me (I know memory is tricky, but he remembers it vaguely too). At the time, I was pretty silly, so I didn't pay much attention. But now, I'm the one considering the idea of declaring myself. \n\nI mean, he's my type. Handsome, not that it's a very necessary requirement, funny, nerdy in the right measure, smelling good, attentive, and many other things. He listens to me, and even though he is VERY closed off and I don't like to dismantle emotions, he has already said that he loves me, he has already made a point of apologizing to me even though he thinks that this is a stupid thing, He even came there when I was crying and apologized, hugged me, anyway. And he also said that I really understand him, even if I don't understand everything, he said that I'm one of the people who understands him the most. And I'm really happy when people say I understand them and trust me. A friend of mine once said this too, and it really makes me happy.\n\nBut the point is, I don't know if I really like him. I feel a bit like that about this other friend I mentioned, let's call her Hazel and him Hunter (both of their real names start with the letter before the H, so my creativity went down the drain). I love Hazel, sometimes I get jealous, the same way I feel with Hunter, when he's too close to my best friend of the trio, Jenny (again, it's not the real name, and it's just one letter before the real name, cut me some slack). My jealousy can be a bit toxic, so it's something I try to control.\n\nI think the problem is that I don't feel retroactive jealousy toward either of them. Something I've felt many times when I've been in other relationships. I don't have as much contact with Hazel because she works part-time and hangs out with other people, and I think I see her more as an older sister who respects me and sees me as a little boy \u2014 what makes me very happy. I've liked her in the past, but I don't feel the same way, I think it's more of an admiration thing. While with Hunter, it's not like that. My jealousy isn't toxic, but sometimes, when I pretend to kiss him, I think about getting just a little closer and actually kissing him.\n\nMy dynamic with him is funny. In high school, we acted like we were dating. People have asked us to kiss (we've done it a few times, because I asked and anyway), they ask if we're dating, etc. Because, it seems. I always make a point of staying close to him, I like to play with his hair when he sleeps in the living room, I like to share the phone with him, to talk to him A LOT, to flirt with him (even just jokingly). And I already joked saying \"if we were dating we wouldn't act like this\" and he agreed. My dynamic with him is different from mine with Jenny. She's not much into physical touch (Hunter isn't either, but he always leaves me open doors), she's quieter, energetic in her own way, and we communicate different. And that is great! \n\nMy feelings for Hunter have only become more confusing now, as I've met him several times. From cute and silly dreams to more intimate ones about couples. And I mentioned dreaming about him, but I didn't elaborate on that out of embarrassment. Because that's the kind of moment where you're afraid of losing a friendship.\n\nI don't know what I should do. He's understanding, he jokes a lot, but he's understanding. But still, I'm afraid of what to do. He had problems in his last relationship, and I don't want to make things awkward, because until then I thought another boy in our class was cute. But it's not the same feeling. That other guy, I just fantasized about a rough future and thought he was cute enough to kiss, period. It's not like that with Hunter. I can imagine my future intertwining with his, and other cheesy things like that, because he treats me better than most people. It's not the feeling I had in other relationships, that they reminded me of someone who loved me very much and I loved him back, but it didn't work out because of the boy's father and then he disappeared. It's something different, I dare say unique.\n\nI just... I really don't know what to do now. It's late, and I'm overthinking it. But it's my way of trying to organize things."}
{"prompt":"What is romance? (23M and 20F) 1 year dating","response":"I have a hard time understanding the significance of this word within the context of movies and TV shows (in how it is depicted in modern society). Because of this, it has strained my relationship with my SO. The way they depict it is almost more heartfelt, but in my eyes, almost without meaning. Things like letters, flowers, chocolates, and handmade gifts, etc., which I do on occasions with Valentine's Day, birthdays and anniversaries. I get that I should maybe do little things here and there outside of this. Apart from this, there is also a need for words of affirmation. Maybe I'm not feeling what I'm supposed to if my words aren't sweet of lovey-dovey, which is an entirely different problem. My understanding of romance feels more plain. When I'm out and my SO is having a bad day, I usually, by default, get their favorite food or drink and come back with it. If my SO wants to do something for a particular day, I make sure to move my schedule around to make time for it. I sit with my SO during hard times and try my best to make them smile or laugh to forget about their problems for a bit. Sometimes I have a habit of trying to fix the problem, which I have been working on, since it can be stressful. I like cooking for my partner, even though I'm terrible at it. I like relieving a lot of their stress at home by handling almost all of the chores. I like being able to just sit and talk about whatever, whether it is serious, whether it is just random, and listen to what my partner wants to say, because I want them to feel heard, but at the same time understand them. I find myself going out of my way to do a lot for my partner, so that their life is a bit easier. But I realize maybe I'm not doing enough. I know from growing up that these ways of care and consideration were what was shown to me as moments of romance at home. So that factors into my lack of comprehension for actions outside it. But maybe i need to change that."}

{"prompt":"How can i move one from a rejection?","response":"I had a lot of crushes in my life, none of them liked me back, but i met this girl this year and she maked me feel something different.

I tried many times talk to her, but i always get extremely nervous, at the point of heart hurts. I manage to get her number and we startet to talk thought message. She doesn't talk much, so i have to always start the conversation and i discovered that we have a lot of things in common. We talked for some time, until she stoped replying my messages. I waited for a reply and sometimes i sended another message, but she never replyied for an entire month. I decided to do something special to her, so i decided to draw her face in a realistic way and it take it 2 days. I menaged to give to her and she seemed really happy with the draw, which maked me happy and hopeful we would start talking again, but still, nothing. My last attempt was to give happy birthday to her, whcih she replied thanks, but it was proably just to be polite, because she didn'treplied after that. I never felt more devasted, it just really hurts, because i really liked her, more than anyone i liked before and it's obvious she is not intrested in me not even be my friend . Everyone i like rejects me and i don't know why. It's my face? It's because i'm chubby? Do i need to be muscular? It's my voice? It's the way i dress?

{"prompt":"I need insight on a confusing love situation","response":"I have liked this guy for 7 months, I confessed to him awhile ago and he rejected me, then we kinda split off after some fight but recently, he apologized, and in his apology he literally stated, \"I did love you but I don't think I can be a good boyfriend.\" I never truly got over him so I feel my feelings coming back slightly and I don't know if I should let them come back or suppress. That one line is now making me wonder alot. A few days after his apology we had another deep talk I said something along the lines of \"I somehow still liked you after everything you did why would I hate you now\" and his response was \"ur cool, I love you too, or whatever... what do I know.\" And its just confusing me so much, is he leading me on, or is he just embarrassed of his feelings, or what? what doesn't help is he has been a lot more interactive with me more then he ever was before."}
{"prompt":"Created this flower","response":"This flower is made of copper I crafted it back in high school, and I\u2019m 34 now, yet it\u2019s still with me. Unlike petals that wilt with time or blooms that fade with the seasons, this one was born to last. It doesn\u2019t wither. It doesn\u2019t lose its color. And neither does the kind of love I believe in.\n\nWhen I shaped it all those years ago, I probably didn\u2019t realize just how much it would come to mean. But now I see it\u2019s more than a project from my youth. It\u2019s a symbol of the way I love: intentional, imperfect, but strong. Weathered by time, but never weakened.\n\nCopper, like real love, doesn\u2019t pretend to be gold. It\u2019s honest. It changes over time deepens in character, takes on a patina from all it\u2019s been through \u2014 and that only makes it more beautiful.\n\nI\u2019ve held onto this flower all these years because it reminds me of what I value most: love that doesn\u2019t fade when things get hard. Love that holds its shape. That survives moves, storms, chapters, and years. And now, when I look at it, I think of the love I still want to give steady, lasting, and true. The kind you can feel in the quiet moments and trust in the loud ones.\n\nSo if I ever give you this flower, just know\u2026 it\u2019s not just a piece of metal. It\u2019s a piece of my heart. It\u2019s everything I hope for and everything I believe in love that won\u2019t die."}

Haven't seen him in 2 years now. Just texting every day. \nWe are not in any committed relationship but we are very close. \nOur first date was on my birthday at the beach late at night. So simple but very effective. I was hooked. I guess he was too. Now it's my birthday once again and I ask him to come see me. He says yes. I'm in shock! Not sure I believe him yet.\nHe actually shows up. I call it a tiny date cuz it's after he gets out of work at 11pm. Not much we can do. I'll take what I can get for my last minute birthday request. \nWe hug tight for a while then sit in his car. Laughs and long conversation for a bit. Catch up on his work life while I watch his neck, his lips, his eyes.\nThen I touch his hand. We start kissing. He reaches over to grab me. Every touch feels like magic forming electrical currents all over my body.   \nThings happen and we don't wanna stop.

{"prompt":"Sharing my first kiss with gf story","response":"For me it was my gf during covid before we became a couple or had even gone on a date. We were hanging out in her car (both had mask on since she had alot of health immune issues). We talked like for three hours after going on a walk and it was nightime by the beach I lived at . I told her Im thinking about doing something and feel you might. She told me to show her because she was thinking what I probaly was. I remember being able to tell she was smiling underneath the mask with her eyes. I took mine off and hers and we kissed for what felt like hours holding hands for the first time and kissing for the first time. Also the first time she fell asleep on me with us watching jurassic park at my apartment . It was also the first night she spent at my place but was just a sweet night  accidentally falling asleep together watching a movie. It was a full moon too.

He picked up the phone at the first ring. We spent the end of the summer meeting up with his friend to go to the beach or eat ice cream, when I moved into my new apartment he was the first one to come and see it.\n\nHe introduced me to all of his friends, we spent almost every evening together, he walked me home, and slept at my place once or twice. We always were very cuddly ever since we met so it was normal to hug and everything when we were out. \n\nBut I started to have a crush on him in November and convinced him to go out with me \"platonically\" at the Christmas market, it was fun we laughed a lot and had fun. \nI confessed on the 31st of December, and he turned me down.\n\nTwo weeks later, he slept at my place and we kissed. He stayed there 3 days, hugging me while we sleep and acting like nothing happened during the day.\nNext week end was the same and we didn't talk about it, so the week after it I had a party at home and it happened again we got a bit drunk and talked about it and decided to get together.\n\nI wondered why he turned me down when he act so In love and he told me it was because of his anxiety.\nI asked him if he liked me before and he told me he never thought he loved anyone else since he was in love with me since high school and never said anything about it because he was too scared.\n\nI love him so much and I'm glad we finally decided to give it a shot because he's taking care of me and I feel like it was always like this. \n\nI just wanted to share that story I don't want advice or anything just wanted to write somewhere how much it helped me \ud83e\udef6 \n\nhave an amazing day"}

{"prompt":"Robbin Williams (A Love Letter)","response":"I\u2019m in love with a girl. It\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve meant the words when I speak them. \u201cI love you\u201d has become a formality for family, but nothing more. Walls, barriers, defenses that I\u2019ve spend decades building to be self-sufficient and strong all fell to nothing when I felt it: That light in my chest, the way that my heart sparked and crackled like a campfire made of electricity inside me when I lay next to her. I think about it a lot when I should be asleep, those nights that I can\u2019t seem to shake off, my mind wandering into odd places in sleeps absence. Where those battle-hardened veterans, that are so casual in conversation despite their experiences, return to their war zones and replay memories of combat through a haze of alcohol and regret. I can only lay there and think of her.\n\nI can\u2019t even imagine how it happened. People talk about setting walls or barriers emotionally, but never have they been so irreparably and suddenly ripped down as the second that I felt your arm reach to touch mine. Those whispers and quiet laughs to not wake our friend who slept by us, quoting stupid memes and jokes between us. Thinking back on it I\u2019ve taken it for granted. \n\nEveryone says it. \u201cYou\u2019ll know it when you find love\u201d and I didn\u2019t believe them. \u201cHow is that? I just stumble into someone and suddenly feel like I can trust them with everything?\u201d I\u2019d argue in my head, hearing the clips of Robbin Williams and his love stories, so ideal and perfect, only brought me to doubt it further. \n\nAnd I did try it, oh don\u2019t get me wrong I tried it a few times. I\u2019ve broken hearts of people I\u2019d have loved to keep as friends and talked about a future with women I had no idea how to begin to love.\n\nNow, months later, I lay in bed and begin to understand. The pure confidence, the unwavering sense of self that came with the revelation that I had indeed been in love in that very moment hit like a mule of both emptiness and fullness all at once. I\u2019ve never realized I could experience emotions this dense, this real. \n\nEver since my brother died, circa 2014, I\u2019ve been empty. As much as I like to say it or my parents like to talk about how much I\u2019ve changed from then it\u2019s all a facade. I\u2019ve been a fortress with no purpose, like an abandoned army base that refuses to close down because we might go back to war someday. I was unready for the rocket that took the form of your gentle touch on my shoulder in a cold night in winter, or the soft pressure of your head on my arm in the store. \n\nYou may think I didn\u2019t notice, you may think I never notice. Another part of my bases clever defenses. Don\u2019t think it, don\u2019t feel it. Don\u2019t ruin it. I can tough out anything, I\u2019ll gnaw my limbs off in a heartbeat if it meant I didn\u2019t have to open up to someone. To be vulnerable with a person in a world that ripped a hero from you so young, it\u2019s a lesson best unlearned through experience. Like a child seeing Superman lose a fight permanently, without the climactic fanfare.\n \nI\u2019m getting off topic. I\u2019ve decided to not delete anything from this, no backspaces. I think it\u2019s best to vomit this out before I sleep.\n\n\nI love you, Megan. \n\nI love you now, I loved you then, and I know I will never stop. I understand you don\u2019t feel the same, I see it in your eyes and feel it in your words. I hope, with every fiber of my being, you find someone who can share in this feeling with you. This love is the most perfect feeling, like my blood has filled with jellyfish who crackle and snap their electric tendrils at the very thought of your name, or the feeling of your arm on mine.\n\nI hope I can show you this, but I know it will be left unread. Another old document in that base that stirs in the wind whenever a breeze blows a cold reminder through it. Though my walls stand strong, the buildings and defenses rebuilt, the memory of your sudden and unrelenting attack lingers in the mind of every soldier within it."}

comienza a latir ya ni puedo dormir solo puedo pensar en este d\u00eda que no me para de cambiar mi forma de pensar, no sab\u00eda que era el amor hasta que la conoc\u00ed y no entiendo c\u00f3mo reaccionar si avanzar o quedarme ah\u00ed yo se que ella todav\u00eda siente algo por su antiguo amor y me pone triste sin raz\u00f3n ni que fu\u00e9ramos algo para ponerme en esta situaci\u00f3n. Solo quiero ser su amor, pero un amor antiguo se interpone en nuestro camino ni se que har\u00eda si volviera con el, posiblemente me destruir\u00e1 m\u00e1s que nunca, pero si ella quiere ser feliz con el la tengo que dejarla ir por que para ella soy su amigo y nada mas, quiero estar  con ella hasta el mundo acabar vivir mi vida con un final donde ella pueda estar pero posiblemente eso no vaya a pasar. no sab\u00eda que las novelas eran reales pero parece que la ficci\u00f3n se convierte en  realidad, no sab\u00eda que el amor era algo que no se pod\u00eda explicar no se porque la amo pero igual la quiero amar, cuando estoy con ella siento paz  y tranquilidad la amo tanto que voy a la escuela solo para hablar con ella 30 minutos para estar feliz hasta que se acabe el d\u00eda, y volver d\u00eda tras d\u00eda para quedarme tranquilo sabiendo que esta bien. sintiendo que alg\u00fan d\u00eda algo vaya a surgir pero se que no va ser as\u00ed pero igual voy a estar ah\u00ed para asegurarme que sea feliz. te amo y no se que mas decir, el atardecer que vimos hoy sent\u00ed una emoci\u00f3n que no comprendo tal ves es el amor que siempre anhelo y quiero entenderlo pero son tan tonto que no comprendo, no se si me ilusione por gusto espero que no sea as\u00ed, posiblemente hoy sue\u00f1e contigo en un futuro felices donde tuvi\u00e9ramos  una casita en la playa jugando con nuestros peque\u00f1itos nuestros hijos y nuestros gatitos disfrutando un atardecer m\u00e1s como el de hoy, posiblemente no pase pero me imaginado tantas vidas contigo que no se si eso alg\u00fan d\u00eda pase y si no pasa por lo menos hoy so\u00f1ar\u00e9 contigo en una vida que jam\u00e1s exista con nuestros peque\u00f1itos aunque solo recuerde unos segunditos de ese sue\u00f1o ser\u00e1 Suficientes para saber que te quiero tanto en ese peque\u00f1o tiempo que posiblemente fueron horas que pasaron volando al estar contigo y te entiendo que no sientas nada por mi si apenas pasaste por una ruptura y se que posiblemente lo amas a \u00e9l y no a mi pero espero que no sea as\u00ed pero posiblemente si,  me pone triste pensar que puede ser que nunca estes a mi lado y eso me pone aterrado tengo miedo de perderte para siempre que alg\u00fan d\u00eda me dejes de hablar de la nada y despertar de este sue\u00f1o que pienso estar, no creo que esto sea real por que esto que siento es algo m\u00e1s que la simple realidad, te amo tanto que hasta mis sue\u00f1os e pensado dejar para estar contigo aunque sea un ratito mas y se que eso esta mal pero no te puedo dejar de pensar y eso me pone mal por que siento que me vas a dejar para estar con el y no entiendo por que pero eso me pone a llorar tanto que escapo de esta realidad para so\u00f1ar contigo y a tu lado estar, aunque sea triste esa es la realidad. tu mirada me agranda mis pupilas cuando te veo y mi cabeza nublada ahora solo piensa en ti parece ese cuento con un d\u00eda so\u00f1\u00e9 estar y comprender que era el amor real, te conoc\u00ed en un mal tiempo para ti y me pone triste que sea as\u00ed a veces pregunto que hubiera pasado si te hubiese conocido antes pero posiblemente paso lo mismo por que como son tan t\u00edmido posiblemente solo te hubiera mirado de lejos y nunca acercarme a ti pero algo cambio en mi cuando te vi no cre\u00eda en el amor a primera vista hasta pens\u00e9 que eras el amor de mi vida pero no sab\u00eda que t\u00fa ya hab\u00edas encontrado el amor primero, sin saber que yo te iba amar tanto.\nRecuerdo cuando te tra\u00eda chocolates t\u00fa pensabas que te los tra\u00eda por que si por que estaba enamorado pero en realidad sab\u00eda por lo que estabas pasando solo te quer\u00eda alegrar un rato el d\u00eda pero te traje tantos que sin darme cuenta ya me hab\u00eda enamorado. que chistoso un hombre que  no cre\u00eda en el amor se hab\u00eda enamorado y ahora pienso que me est\u00e1 pasando y es el amor en el que nunca hab\u00eda pensado es il\u00f3gico que me enamore tan r\u00e1pido de una persona que apenas conozco nunca me hab\u00eda pasado no se que me atrae de ti pero creo que el amor es as\u00ed y ahora que lo entend\u00ed es bonito y me pone a sufrir pensar que no est\u00e1s aqu\u00ed .\nY\n\nY me pone triste pensar que en otra vida fu\u00e9ramos felices y en esta solo pensar que lo fuimos.\n\n04\/10\/2024\n\nMe despert\u00e9 y pens\u00e9 en ti y entend\u00ed y peque\u00f1o concepto del amor que comenzar\u00e9 a escribir\n\nEl amor es querer y procurar al otro verlo crecer, verlo progresar, verlo desarrollarse ,verlo ser feliz aunque aveces eso no te incluye a ti\n\nMe di cuenta que aunque no est\u00e9 contigo si alg\u00fan d\u00eda te casas tienes t\u00fa hijos y seas feliz al estar sin mi, me tengo que dar cuenta que ser\u00e1s feliz , ver como te enamoras de otro que no sea yo, que veas como se hace de noche con el alado mientras yo vi\u00e9ndolo en otra lado pensando en que hubiera pasado si estuvieras a mi lado pero tengo que entender que a veces ni el verdadero amor dura para siempre: Y ni se que digo si ni no hemos besado ni caminado tomados de la mano ni viajando juntos a otro lado pero a\u00fan as\u00ed estoy enamorado anhelando que alg\u00fan d\u00eda eso hubiera pasado.\n\nDicen que amar es compartir, pero creo que no se refer\u00eda al intercambio material ,si no al emocional(El amor).\n\nSigo pensando en ti otro d\u00eda m\u00e1s sin dormir\nIntentando olvidar lo que siento por ti pero como siempre fallando y pensando que hubiera pasado si te hubiera conocido antes que el, no entiendo como te pueden hacer tanto da\u00f1o a ti que eres un \u00e1ngel sin alas , una hada en un bosque encantado ,una princesa que cualquier hombre a deseado.\n\nYo solo quiero ser el refugio que mereces.\nEse alguien que te pueda cuidar cuando nadie mas pueda estar y pensar eso me duele mas por que posiblemente haya pasado en otra realidad o eso quiero pensar que por lo menos un yo te pudo cuidar.\n\n05\/10\/2024 \n\nSigo pensado en lo que paso aunque no ser\u00e1 nada para ti, para mi fue lo m\u00e1s lindo que me a pasado y si para ti no signific\u00f3 nada, no importa yo lo recuerdo como algo hermoso, que estar\u00e1 para siempre en mi coraz\u00f3n y nunca lo olvidar\u00e9.\nNo sab\u00eda que un peque\u00f1o atardecer contigo a mi lado era mas bonito que ver una maravilla del mundo.\nY pienso que hubiera pasado si en ese momento hubiera dado el siguiente paso, pero posiblemente nunca lo habr\u00eda hecho sabiendo c\u00f3mo soy, no se si alg\u00fan d\u00eda lo haga pero tengo miedo de que nunca pase y si nunca pasa es por algo, no?\nNo se si cambiar mi futuro para estar contigo pero si lo tengo que hacer no lo pensar\u00eda dos veces por que mi destino est\u00e1 contigo.\n\nEspero poder verte ser feliz aunque no sea conmigo, espero que vivas tu vida so\u00f1ada con \u00e9l a tu lado, que cumplas todos tus sue\u00f1os pero espero yo ser \u00e9l, para estar a tu lado.\n\nNo se que vi en ti para a verme enamorado as\u00ed ,\nCuando mi alma vio a la tuya sent\u00ed una conexi\u00f3n que no puedo explicar, espero que mi coraz\u00f3n no se haya confundido al elegirte a ti, porque mi coraz\u00f3n ya es tuyo y, si lo quieres romper, primero te sacar\u00eda de ah\u00ed para no hacerte da\u00f1o.\n\nEspero amarte tanto como la primera vez que te vi, espero amar como lo que alg\u00fan d\u00eda sent\u00ed que te esperar\u00eda hasta el fin ,pero se que todo tiene un final y tengo miedo de que no sea contigo, pero tengo que aceptar esta realidad por que as\u00ed es el amor no?\nNo importa el tiempo\nPor que t\u00fa solo me importas, para que sirve el tiempo si no vas a estar a mi lado, para que contar como pasas los d\u00edas  si no estas conmigo.\npor que no puedo parar el tiempo para verte un poco m\u00e1s \u00bfpor que!!?\nPienso que si alg\u00fan d\u00eda est\u00e1s conmigo te har\u00eda muy feliz, Pero t\u00fa no piensas lo mismo no?\nPor que t\u00fa quieres ser feliz con \u00e9l.\nPero as\u00ed es el amor ni una ruptura lo separa no se si t\u00fa lo amas a \u00e9l como yo te amo a ti y si es as\u00ed entiendo por que quieres estar con el y no conmigo si ese amor que yo siento lo sientes t\u00fa por el, ahora entiendo todo, no me lo hab\u00eda puesto a pensar as\u00ed.\nPero si es as\u00ed espero que lo ames hasta el fin como yo lo har\u00eda por ti.\n\nEl amor son partes del tiempo que se dan sin importar la causa que hay por en medio  son como \u00e1tomos que conectan entre si pero sin tocarse, pero igual se siente.\n\nNo se como un ser ama a otro ser por que dos almas se aman entre s\u00ed  y conectan tan perfecto que duele tanto separase. pero creo que ya lo entend\u00ed por que cuando las dos almas se juntan se hacen una y cuando se vuelen a separa ya una alma se llevo una parte de la otra\nY por eso siempre va estar ah\u00ed, pero creo que lo llaman recuerdos.\n\nMe pongo a pensar si mi hilo rojo esta conectado con el tuyo, y si es as\u00ed, alg\u00fan d\u00eda vamos a estar juntos no? Aunque alg\u00fan d\u00eda no me acuerde de tu nombre,ni de tu cara, ni como eras ,ni de quien eres, espero conocerte de nuevo, pero igual creo que nunca me voy a olvidar.\n\nDir\u00e9 algo muy bonito y triste a la vez:\nSi pudiera cortar mi hilo rojo para conectar con el tuyo lo har\u00eda pero me pongo a pensar si lo hago tendr\u00e9 que cortar el tuyo para conectarlo con el m\u00edo y aunque haga el nudo  mas fuerte del mundo, Alg\u00fan d\u00eda se va a desatar y se volver\u00e1n a separar, por eso no cortar\u00eda tu hilo rojo, para dejar que encuentres a tu amor, aunque t\u00fa seas \nel m\u00edo.\n\nEn este planeta llamado tierra, el amor no es el mismo que yo te hab\u00eda pensado dar, por que el m\u00edo es infinito como el big bang que se va expandir tanto pero no se como vaya a terminar.\nY tengo miedo que alg\u00fan d\u00eda vaya a explotar por que no se como vas a reaccionar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPD: Esta foto la foto que vieron de la primer vez que vimos el atardecer.\ud83c\udf05 \n\n\n\n06\/10\/2024\n\nHoy pens\u00e9 que no iba escribir nada pero aqu\u00ed estoy pensado en tu mirada.\nQuiero abrazarte aun que no quieras un abrazo y pensar que te amo tanto me esta haciendo mal por que creo que t\u00fa no sientes lo mismo y ese abrazo que te quiero dar tal vez nunca te lo dar\u00e9,\nEspero te que el te abraze  como yo lo har\u00eda y que te ame  como yo te amar\u00eda y sabiendo  que seas tan feliz y que ya no tenga que preocuparme por ti.\n\nPosiblemente este amor que siento no lo sientas\nTal vez lo que pienso no lo piensas,\nY tal vez tenga que olvidar esos recuerdos, \nPero el amor est\u00e1n bonito que aunque me haga da\u00f1o no lo quiera soltar.(no quiero soltarte)\n\nPensaba que la luna era lo m\u00e1s bonito del planeta pero despu\u00e9s llegaste t\u00fa y parece que cambie de parecer.\n\nEspero ser el amor que siempre so\u00f1aste, quiero pensar que lo soy, pero creo que no es as\u00ed ,mi cabeza se llena de dudas y no se como resolverlas, quiero entender mas de lo que nunca quise comprender.\nQuiero ser el te haga sonre\u00edr,con el que se te pasa el tiempo volando,\nQue no importen los d\u00edas que pasen, siempre estar a tu lado.\n\n16\/10\/2024\nSe acab\u00f3\u2026.\nEl amor no se acaba solo se olvida.\nY tengo que olvidar \nTodav\u00eda lo amas y lo entiendo ya entend\u00ed que tengo que dejarte ir y lo voy a hacer para que puedas pensar y recuperar tu coraz\u00f3n roto no creo que yo lo pueda arreglar as\u00ed que voy a dejar que tomes tu camino para que encuentres tu paz y serenidad y no detengas tus sue\u00f1os y entiendas que \nYa no hay que vivir en el pasado si no en este presente aunque no estes con el, para que logres tus objetivos y si no tienes que los encuentres espero que te vaya bien  pero aqu\u00ed nos despedimos mi primer amor.\n(Te amo perd\u00f3n por dejarte ir pero lo tengo que hacer para que encontrar nuestros caminos)\n \nCon este peque\u00f1o cuento me despido todo esto lo escrib\u00ed en una noche (menos las notas de 2024) no es mucho pero es lo suficiente para olvidar esto y despejar ese sentimiento aunque no lo olvide solo aprend\u00ed a vivir con ello dentro."}
{"prompt":"How do people that struggle with dating meet someone?","response":"Not sure if this is the right question to ask. I'm 23m and my dating life is non existent. I have never been on a date before. The closest I have ever been to any type of relationship was with a girl in college. We met on YikYak of all places. One night she posted and I dropped my Snapchat and we started talking. Over the next few months we would hang out and spend time together mostly on the weekends. I thought she liked me, but I am convinced now she was using me because I had connections for parties and was one of her few friends that was also 21 at the time so we would go to the campus pub together. It got to the point where we were holding hands but nothing more than that. When I tried to ask her on a more formal date she put me down. I have tried asking out women I know and liked, using dating apps or meeting women at bars. Nothing has worked for me. I am a decent looking guy who works out has career goals and ambitions. I am finishing my master's degree and interning at a state government agency currently. My one issue is that I'm a bit shy and introverted. Sometimes I think to myself that woman is cute I should talk to her, but then I just don't. I am just curious what you have done so I can learn or change up my game."}

Then boom a year later when I myself forgot about that instance he brings it up teasing me in front of my friends saying that I like that senior.. like why TF he even remembers it.. am I reading in too much or is it normal for guys to remember nonsense details and ship people with the ones who they don't like?"}

{"prompt":"I told my friend I like her","response":"There was this girl in my class 20F. So when I first saw this person I thought she is attractive and I tried to make a move. I got close to her a bit trying to make a move and talk but a friend of mine that knew I like her, told her that I like her and she said she is not interested. About 6 month after, me and this girl started studying with each other and we became very close friends, we hanged out a lot and some nights that we were talking on phone call for 1hour. And the period that we became close friends I already had a gf. I broke up with my GF and couple of months after she became cold with me and we didn\u2019t really talk until recently that she again started to get close to me. I felt I kinda like her\u2026 now that I was not friends with her and she got close to me even more.\nSo tonight we went out and I told her u need to know Im finding feelings towards you. She didn\u2019t freak out or shock, she was relaxed. Thing is that she was planning a trip to my new town that I will go. So I told her listen, since you are gonna come to my house you need to know something. I feel I found emotions toward you and felt the necessity to let you know. She was with a normal attitude and she said actually I have to tell you that the days I stopped talking to you was because I thought you were getting too close to me. Then she said so if u are uncomfortable I wont come to your town and I said no no its not that, I just wanted to let you know about this since you are gonna spend time with me there and its better if you are aware of this. Then we talked about other stuff and we didn\u2019t really talk about this and said goodbye. She was more like a \u201cok good to know\u201d\n\nAny ideas? Its negative right? What should I do now?

We are deciding to wait to get together so we can figure everything out, but what if he changes his mind? I don't want someone to change their mind about me again. I don't want my heart broken again.

But I already started liking him and he is honestly every thing I look for in a guy he is 100% my type but every time the age gap pops in my head it just feels weird.

So along with the gifts and celebrating I also enrolled us into this competition that day. \n\nI\u2019ve been with the absolute love of my life now for a little over 3 years. I\u2019m planning an engagement, and we both see ourselves marrying each other in the near future. And ideally, in a dreamworld, this is where this competition comes in. The winners of this contest receive a cover on a magazine and a monetary prize of 20,000 dollars. I have a vision of marrying Angelica in the city she grew up in, New Orleans. It is her favorite city in America and she, unfortunately, was forced to leave it behind at a young age by Hurricane Katrina. One way or another I will find a way to take her back to her home and marry her there, but winning this thing would sure help, and make for an epic proposal. \n\nPlease, will you help me in this mission.

{"prompt":"The One That Got Away (Pt.2)","response":"After a while, things changed.\n\nShe started dating this guy named Jake. At first, I thought, \"Good for her.\" She deserved someone who could give her what I couldn\u2019t. But as the months went by, I noticed things weren\u2019t as perfect as they seemed. Jake was\u2026 well, he was the kind of guy who took more than he gave. The little things she used to do\u2014her smile, her laugh\u2014started fading. She didn\u2019t say much, but it was clear that being with Jake was taking its toll on her.\n\nA year went by, and then it all came crashing down. They broke up. I could see how drained she was, the weight of it all on her shoulders. She had given so much to someone who didn\u2019t appreciate her, the same way I had been in the past. And in a twist of fate, she ended up moving in with me, temporarily at first. We told ourselves it was just friends helping each other out, but it was more than that.\n\nWe spent more time together than we had in years. Late-night talks on the couch, sharing meals, watching shows together. It felt comfortable, like old times, but there was a new kind of tension. She wasn\u2019t the same girl I knew before Jake\u2014she was more vulnerable, more desperate for someone to see her, truly see her.\n\nThen one night, she broke down.\n\nWe were sitting on the couch, talking about nothing in particular when she just started crying. She told me she was tired\u2014tired of chasing people who didn\u2019t value her, tired of giving and giving only to be left empty. And then she looked at me with those eyes, the same ones that used to be full of hope, and said, \u201cJust give me a chance. Please. I\u2019ll prove it to you. I\u2019ll be everything you need. Just trust me.\u201d\n\nHer words hit me like a freight train. She was so raw, so desperate for something real, and there I was, still holding onto my fears. I had turned her down so many times, thinking I was protecting myself, but now\u2026 now she was the one who needed protecting. And it wasn\u2019t just about her anymore. I realized I needed her, too. The emptiness inside me, the hopelessness I carried, started to crack.\n\nSo I said yes. I wasn\u2019t fully committed, I wasn\u2019t even sure if I could love her the way she wanted, but I couldn\u2019t bear to see her hurting like that anymore. I told myself that maybe, just maybe, I could make this work.\n\nAt first, it felt like we were walking on thin ice. I wasn\u2019t sure how to let her in, and she was still healing from Jake. But slowly, things started to change. She brought energy into my life that I hadn\u2019t felt in years. It wasn\u2019t just about being in a relationship\u2014it was about having someone who truly cared about me, who wanted to see me happy.\n\nShe\u2019d push me to do things I never thought I\u2019d enjoy. Weekend hikes, spontaneous trips to the coast, even just getting me out of the house to grab coffee. I didn\u2019t realize how much I had been living in my own bubble until she burst it open. She made me laugh, made me feel alive in ways I\u2019d long forgotten. And slowly, she healed something in me that I didn\u2019t even know was still broken.\n\nI\u2019ll admit, at first, I wasn\u2019t all in. I was still guarded, still holding back. But she didn\u2019t give up on me. She never gave up. And one day, I woke up and realized that I wasn\u2019t the same person I had been before. The weight I\u2019d carried from past relationships, from all the times I\u2019d been used or hurt, it didn\u2019t feel so heavy anymore. She had changed me, piece by piece, without me even realizing it.\n\nI wasn\u2019t hopeless anymore. I was\u2026 alive.\n\nShe was still the girl who had begged me to give her a chance, but now, she didn\u2019t have to ask. I saw her for who she was, and I realized she had been right all along. She was the one person who had stuck by me when no one else had, who saw me even when I couldn\u2019t see myself. And I loved her for that. It took time, but eventually, I gave her everything I had.\n\nI wish I could say that everything was perfect from then on, that we rode off into the sunset without any more bumps in the road. But that\u2019s not how life works. We still had our struggles, our moments of doubt. But the difference now was that I wasn\u2019t alone in facing them. She was with me, every step of the way, and for the first time in my life, I believed I was worth that kind of love.\n\nShe had changed my life. From a hopeless, guarded person to someone who finally believed that love wasn\u2019t something to be feared. It was something to be embraced. And all it took was the one person who never gave up on me, even when I had given up on myself."}
{"prompt":"Existentialism is a Humanism","response":"I recently have decided to get back into reading again after neglecting doing so for far too long. \nI decided to start with Sartre\u2019s Existentialism is a Humanism & I am about 1\/3 of the way through. I thought it would be interesting to ask you guys for your thoughts and perspectives especially before completing the book just to take into consideration while reading. I\u2019ve already started forming my perspective on the book in regards to what i have read so far, but have always enjoyed challenging my own biases & perceptions & thought it would add an interesting layer to the book. \nThe book alone is already pretty different from my own outlook especially in terms of free will. I feel I more recently adopted the ideology that we have little to almost no free will & not in a pessimistic sense, but more so I feel like life foreshadows itself (in my experience) too often to just be coincidence. \nI want to emphasize my use of the word adoption though since my thoughts surrounding free will are just that, thoughts that I\u2019m nurturing for now and just seeing where they go."}

{"prompt":"Is Jane Eyre a feminist novel? - What do you think!","response":"I'm a Scottish student, and I recently finished my sixth year English Lit class. A large area of discussion was the feminist angle that Jane Eyre had as a novel. I unfortunately was at the mercy of a class full of only 4 people including myself; all three of whom believed Jane Eyre was an anti-feminist portrayal of a woman and showed weak character development through Jane. I personally believed that Jane Eyre was a very significant piece of feminist literature and was absolutely baffled by their thought process, so please feel free to let me know what you thought! \n\nI believed that the progression of Jane's personality throughout the book was extremely well written and consistent. She grew up in an abusive and neglectful home, before being sent away to a boarding school with only one friend whom died in her arms. This already sets out the narrative that Jane will have developmental issues surrounding attachment. This is portrayed well at the beginning of the novel when Jane has power over Rochester in the horse scene, and when she exclaims that she will never care to see her aunt again. She is seen to be independent and feel as though she deserves more than what she was given. This is where I first noticed Janes feminist approach to her life. She was strong and independent in a time where women were looked down upon and lacked security without a male or familial counterpart. She worked for herself and made decisions based upon her interest. Even when attempting to marry Rochester she is aware of her worth as a woman and doesn't allow herself to be conned into a partnership. Understandably the most controversial part of this novel is when Jane returns to Rochester even after his lies. However, I felt strongly that this was in fact the most feminist and empowering point in the novel. Despite Rochester's negative actions, the power dynamic between them once again shifts as Jane receives her fortune and Rochester loses his sight. Jane makes the decision to go back to Rochester with full control over her actions. The contrast of it potentially not being a choice the reader necessarily agrees with is important as it shows that despite your disagreement as a reader, it was a completely independent and free willed choice for Jane to make; in a society where marriage and love was often forced on women.\n\nI felt this was a pretty clear answer however the majority of people in my ADVH class disagreed with me, so I was curious as to what the majority vote was. :)\n\nP.S. Please be aware this is a very condensed point of view, I PROMISE I have more fleshed out points than this hahaha."}

I also work as a waitress in a local Inn, which is a job that I dearly love.

I will most definitely read more by him and am very open to suggestions. I generally like literature by jewish men written mid century, and am a big philosemetic\nI also like the writing of J.D Salinger but have grown tired of him after overdosing on his short stories in the past six months (and I\u2019ve read \u201eDream catcher\u201c by his quite talented daughter, which gave me a slightly sour feel about him)\nI enjoy feminist literature in the vein of German feminists as well.

I\u2019m very excited to read it. But when I woke up this morning (I sleep with my books on my bed, flipping through pages is calming for me), Crime and Punishment fell, and its bottom right corner for the front cover was folded into itself (so, the front cover was touching the first page, y\u2019know).\n\nMy family\u2019s poor, so getting books is already hard, and this one is especially big since it\u2019s a very high quality version of the book. I love the design of the front cover, the texture, and how the pages feel, it\u2019s all organic. Thus, it\u2019s made me very sad that it\u2019s been folded. The two things I\u2019ve done to try and fix it is gently folding it the opposite way, and placing books on top of it to flatten it out. Both have works, but there\u2019s still a visible dent.\n\nIs this the worst thing ever? No, but I\u2019m very bummed out that it happened in the first place.

{"prompt":"Akutagawa is absolutely fantastic","response":"Currently reading Rashomon and 17 other stories, translated by Jay Rubin and holy shit.....they are on another level. Totally understand why he was a favourite of Borges(still kind of bummed that they didn't include his' masterpiece Kappa). The translations are lucid highly readable and lyrical and it actually feels that he took great care in transporting the style into English(with their flaws and idiosycracies)there is a palpable difference between the mood and tone and prose etc. between the earliest stories and more mature stories. The introduction by Haruki Murakami is also brilliant and surprisingly scholarly.\n\nHe is definitely very different from a lot of other Japanese writers I have read. I couldn't say his writing style is as sophisticated as someone like Kawabata or Mishima but the intensity of his pessimism and morbid humour is definitely missing in most Japanese literature I have read(except perhaps Mishima and Kobo Abe). He is definitely very western in form(Charles Baudelaire, Dostoevsky and Poe were some of his big influences) and I could definitely see why Haruki Murakami loves him because of that but his concerns and contents are intensely Japanese. One of the many criticisms of Kenzaburo Oe against Mishima was that he was playing a role of a Japanese envisioned by Europe with his writings and personal life but you cannot say that about Akutagawa. There is something intensely Japanese about him but at the same time he has a very modern cosmopolitan feel to him. When you read this collection it is very much pronounced that the historical stories are as much as a part of Akutagawa as much as his stories where characters read Dostoevsky and Speak French. There is something very modern and versatile in everything about him even though these were written 100 Years ago.\n\nI simply don't think it's possible to write elaborately about all the stories (because I still haven't read all of them and I simply think it's impossible to write about them in a brief reddit post) so I would focus on the story I liked the most\n\nThe Spinning Gears is an extremely haunting,sad and also kind of morbidly funny story. When the story starts you expect it to be a ghost story, but it quickly turn into a portrait of a self loathing,broken and lost man spiralling into slow breakdown as the world turns more strange around him. It's full of symbols and really fascinating insights into Akutagawa's mental state and writing habits but it's also such a good long look into mental illness. The whole story truly feels like a panic attack and it's confessional style makes it more painful. There is also a palpable feeling of god less ness in there considering Akutagawa's complicated feelings towards spirituality and religion it is very fascinating and funny to see how the protagonist couldn't believe in god yet feels that he could believe in devil's miracle. The final lines are also extremely haunting:\n\n\"Isn't there someone kind enough to strangle me in my sleep?\"\n\nJust tragic and devastating considering that shortly after this he would commit suicide."}

{"prompt":"Epiphanic moments of chilling beauty: Your favorite passages?","response":"If you have not read Henry James's masterpiece *The Portrait of a Lady*, you might not want to read the passage below. For those who are curious, the below passage comes from the rather legendary Ch. 42 where the eponymous Isabel Archer sits down in front of the fire after everyone has gone to bed, and then proceeds, over the course of 5,900 words, to reflect on the awful fact that she has made a terrible mistake in marrying Gilbert Osmond and will likely suffer for it for many years to come: \n\n>*It had come gradually\u2014it was not till the first year of their life together, so admirably intimate at first, had closed that she had taken the alarm. Then the shadows had begun to gather; it was as if Osmond deliberately, almost malignantly, had put the lights out one by one. The dusk at first was vague and thin, and she could still see her way in it. But it steadily deepened, and if now and again it had occasionally lifted there were certain corners of her prospect that were impenetrably black. These shadows were not an emanation from her own mind: she was very sure of that; she had done her best to be just and temperate, to see only the truth. They were a part, they were a kind of creation and consequence, of her husband\u2019s very presence. They were not his misdeeds, his turpitudes; she accused him of nothing\u2014that is but of one thing, which was\u00a0not\u00a0a crime. She knew of no wrong he had done; he was not violent, he was not cruel: she simply believed he hated her.*\n\n  \nI feel strongly that James is slept on in virtually every facet of internet culture: Reddit, BookTube, etc. This has always mystified me because his near bottomless oeuvre is loaded with psychological insights of surpassing beauty."}

I can say for sure Mervyn Peake is unlike any other author I\u2019ve read before. At times I\u2019m captivated and others it feels like I\u2019m sifting through a lot of useless prose.  It took me 50 pages to get \u201chooked\u201d but the only thing that kept me going was the imagery. \n\nThe man can paint with words that\u2019s for sure but in other instances it\u2019s hard to find a continued rhythm for reading. I feel like I\u2019m missing some symbolism as well at times and in other instances his vocabulary choices have me reaching for a dictionary (sometimes multiple times per page). My father recommended that I try reading the series and said it was \u201ca dividing piece of work\u201d with people either thinking the author is genius or insanely bad. I think there\u2019s a real mix between the two, there\u2019s no real inner monologues for characters but they\u2019re still somehow the driving force of the story despite being fairly unlikable at some points. The range in these books in terms of ability is pretty intense."}

I think that his perspective is so valuable and it\u2019s interesting to see how his sense of self shifts and essentially deteriorates over time.\n\nHe even predicted his fate of being remembered in a far off time. Though the book was written between 1913 and 1935, it didn\u2019t see the light of day until 1982 and has since become an important literary work. I only wish that I could reach back in time to show him that others truly care about what he has to say. He died too young.

{"prompt":"Books that use their length as a plot device","response":"I recently finished two extremely long novels and it occurred to me how they use their length as a means to achieve particular themes.\n\nRed Mars by Kim Stanley Robinson: This is a novel about the first colony on mars and humanity's effort to turn the planet into a livable place. it feels like half the book is people driving or flying around mars and looking at the scenery and describing geologic formations. I felt that the monotony, boringness, and lack of any living flora\/fauna really served well in conveying the desolation of mars and isolation one might feel while trying to start a colony on a previously lifeless uninhabited planet. Long stretches of the novel were really boring, took endurance to read, and dry (pun intended)\n\nA Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara: way too many pages are spent describing in detail both the abuse Jude experiences as well as his self-harming activities. Over 800 pages, the novel covers his life from birth into adulthood. The unending barrage of trauma, the repetitiveness, and the persistent maladaptive response to trauma pervading his entire life is made all the more visceral by the book's length.

Sendo o primeiro volume da \"Cr\u00f4nica do Matador do Rei\", a novela liter\u00e1ria se apresenta como o primeiro cap\u00edtulo de um \u00e9pico conto sobre um h\u00e9roi lend\u00e1rio, cujos nomes n\u00e3o lhe faltam: O Arcano, O sem sangue, *O matador  do rei*. E a forma escolhida para contar esta hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 um tanto peculiar, mas n\u00e3o in\u00e9dita. \n\nIsso se d\u00e1 pelo fato de o livro ser narrado, durante a maior parte do texto, no passado, na primeira pessoa do singular. Relatos da mem\u00f3ria perfeccionista de um tevernista, que na juventude se tornou um mago poderoso, o que nos faz questionar a confiabilidade destas mem\u00f3rias. A hist\u00f3ria se inicia quando um cronista viaja at\u00e9 a cidade onde o tal sujeito tem sua taberna. O homem das letras, de alguma forma, reconhece o tavernista com fogo nos cabelos como o personegem principal das lendas que podem ser ouvidas por toda a Temerant, da rep\u00fablica, at\u00e9 os montes tempestuosos. Seu nome \u00e9 Kvothe, e ele concorda em contar sua hist\u00f3ria em tr\u00eas dias. Nem mais, nem menos. \n\nO primeiro livro cobre todo o primeiro dia, e at\u00e9 o momento em que este post \u00e9 escrito, os leitores s\u00f3 podem ler at\u00e9 o segundo dia na cronologia da hist\u00f3ria, uma vez que \"O temor do s\u00e1bio\" segundo livro da trilogia, foi publicado a quatorze anos atr\u00e1s, e \"As portas de pedra\" segue em processo de escrita. O hiato ainda n\u00e3o tem data para acabar, e os f\u00e3s do invocador do vento de cabelos ruivos continuam esperando pacientemente pelo pr\u00f3ximo cap\u00edtulo da hist\u00f3ria que ser\u00e1 em breve adaptada para outras m\u00eddias pela Lionsgate. E os motivos para tanta paci\u00eancia n\u00e3o s\u00e3o poucos. Os f\u00e3s do g\u00eanero fant\u00e1stico s\u00e3o os mais pacientes de todos os tempos, e as provas est\u00e3o a baixo. \n\nDepois de N\u00e1rnia, da Terra M\u00e9dia, Westeros, e Hogwarts, a era dos livros de fantasia parecia ter chegado ao fim. Novas obras de fantasia eram publicadas constantemente, mas nunca faltaram aqueles cuja opni\u00e3o as reduzia a meros \"mais do mesmo\". At\u00e9 que Rothfuss apresenta, na hora certa, o aconchegante e assombroso mundo de Temerant, atrav\u00e9s de \"O nome do vento\", que lhe rendeu o Quill Award de melhor literatura fant\u00e1stica do ano de 2007. Um dos pontos mais fortes de \"O nome do Vento\" \u00e9 o sistema de magia criado com tanta min\u00facia por Rothfuss, e os personagens que o mesmo nos apresenta para ensin\u00e1-lo a Kvothe, e ao leitor. \n\nA \"magia\", na falta de um nome melhor, \u00e9 representada como um estudo s\u00e9rio e concreto, durante a maior parte da obra, com regras definidas, e um funcionamento uniforme, mesmo nos momentos de mais a\u00e7\u00e3o do livro. O que faz com que, por mais que o livro seja uma fantasia, elementos de realismo sejam acrescidos, o que nos leva a ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o do mundo do livro, que \u00e9 muito bem executada. As tabernas, as estalagens, a universidade, as propriedades de membros da c\u00f4rte, a gest\u00e3o da faculdade, e o modo de ensino remontam ao per\u00edodo do iluminismo p\u00f3s idade m\u00e9dia, de forma que o leitor pode se esquecer de o livro \u00e9 na verdade, uma hist\u00f3ria sobre vingan\u00e7a. O que nos leva a principal engrenagem que faz esta s\u00e9rie funcionar, que \u00e9 seu personagem principal, aquele que narra e vive os fatos na trama. \n\nKvothe \u00e9 um personagem em busca de vingan\u00e7a, mas diferentemente de tantos outros na hist\u00f3ria da literatura, n\u00e3o a busca cegamente, com selvageria e descontrole. Sua cria\u00e7\u00e3o, mesmo ap\u00f3s anos dif\u00edceis em que fez coisas das quais n\u00e3o se orgulha, n\u00e3o foi esquecida. Kvothe \u00e9, inicialmente, um menino prod\u00edgio em plena forma\u00e7\u00e3o, e entende que n\u00e3o representa nenhuma amea\u00e7a a seus inimigos na condi\u00e7\u00e3o em que se encontrava. O menino escolhe ent\u00e3o jogar o jogo longo, com paci\u00eancia, contruindo pouco a pouco a si mesmo, tornando-se mais forte, o que faz de \"O nome do Vento\", especificamente, um volume na s\u00e9rie essencialmente introdut\u00f3rio. \n\nAs primeiras 200 p\u00e1ginas s\u00e3o dedicadas n\u00e3o s\u00f3 a inf\u00e2ncia, e a apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o de Kvothe como protagonista, mas tamb\u00e9m a constru\u00e7\u00e3o do mundo de Temerant, e sua mitologia. Parte essa que pode ser um pouco ma\u00e7ante para leitores menos acostumado com escritas lentas como a de Tolkien. Passadas as primeiras duzentas p\u00e1ginas, \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel entediar-se com os trechos onde Kvothe luta para afirmar sua presen\u00e7a, e obter a aprova\u00e7\u00e3o de professores que o menosprezam, ou subestimam na Academia, e lida com contra-tempos causados por rivais. \n\nPor\u00e9m, \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel falar de \"O nome do Vento\" sem citar os momentos de calmaria, em que o protagonista simplesmente passa tempo com seus amigos, toma uma cerveja, e toca seu ala\u00fade para um pequeno grupo de pessoas numa taberna para ganhar o p\u00e3o, e um lugar onde repousar a cabe\u00e7a.\n\n\"O nome do vento\" \u00e9, al\u00e9m de ser o primeiro volume de uma saga de alta fantasia, o primeiro cap\u00edtulo de uma hist\u00f3ria que executa com maestria a jornada do h\u00e9roi. Mas nos adianta o acr\u00e9ssimo de uma etapa pouco comum: A decad\u00eancia. Sendo narrada pelo pr\u00f3prio Kvothe, mais velho, \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel n\u00e3o notar a disto\u00e2ncia entre o lend\u00e1rio Arcano, mesmo que em forma\u00e7\u00e3o, e o velho tavernista, velho, cansado, melanc\u00f3lico. \n\n\"O nome do Vento\" \u00e9, por tudo isso, uma brisa fresca para os fi\u00e9is leitores do g\u00eanero fant\u00e1stico, que ser\u00e3o recompensados por sua espera com esta brilhante saga."}

This post contains spoilers. \\[I also posted this in r\/books last week, but I want to talk more!\\]\n\nAs a book concerned with therapy and\u00a0the effects of trauma, I think one of the central themes of Big Swiss is the unacknowledged (some might say unconscious) gap between what people mean and what they say, or the importance of what's missing in the text, and I'm especially interested in how the book explores this theme formally. To be clear, the book tips its hand early on, when Greta tells Om she wants to \"transcribe ... silence\" because\n\n>\"the pain is rarely in the actual words, which nine times out of ten are imprecise, or the wrong words altogether. People are almost never articulate about their pain, as I'm sure you've noticed. Their pain can only really be felt in the pauses, which aren't included in the transcript.\"\n\nBut that's just content! Big Swiss also realizes this idea formally in at least a few (non-exhaustive) ways:\n\nFirst of course is the disconnect between what Greta hears on the audio recordings and what we read in the transcript she produces. (Ironically, I started with the audio version of this book--big mistake! Something is lost when Greta's transcript reads \"\\[whistling\\]\" and the narrator literally whistles.) This disconnect is redoubled by the end, when it's suggested that Big Swiss is itself the novel Om suggested Greta write, which really just highlights the way in which all text is mediated. Indeed, Greta's letters to her dead mother show the absolute outer limit of Greta's control over meaning--she can write the letters, but even if it were possible for her to perfectly express herself (debatable), they would still depend on a reader to interpret them.\n\nSecond is the disconnect between how different characters describe (or fail to describe) the same interactions; this usually comes up when Greta does something with Flavia, then Flavia recounts the experience differently to Om. Especially jarring for me was when Flavia brought up new details (so, not just new perspectives) that Greta previously missed, ignored, or intentionally failed to mention. One variation of this is how different characters perceive the same empirical events, such as Luke's fight with Keith, or whether Flavia is being stalked. Another is the difference in topics Flavia\u00a0discusses with Greta and with Om and the relevant information she withholds from each (e.g., her reinvigorated sex life with Luke\/her affair with Greta). Marginally more subtle is the repeated failure of people to match the narrator's expectations for them.\n\nThere's a nice contrast, then, between Flavia's early assertion that she doesn't identify with and is unaffected by her trauma--text which Greta initially takes at face value and is drawn to--and Sabine's confession of her drug addiction at the end of the book--for her, addiction, like trauma, is a repressed but persistent force that interrupts\/erupts into the everyday. (I'm sure there's a parallel with the bees hiding in the walls as well.)\n\nFinally, this theme is wonderfully captured in the form of the only poem Greta knows by heart, E.E. Cummings's\u00a0*Yes Is A Pleasant Country*. Each stanza includes a line that's offset by parentheses, words spoken aside, text outside the main text. But of course those offset lines are critical to the overall coherence and form of the poem--without them,\u00a0*Yes*\u00a0would not maintain its 7-3-3-5 syllabic structure, and the third stanza would not rhyme with the first or second. Which is to say, just as Greta is shaped by the trauma of her mother's suicide, the details of which she cannot speak until the end of the book,\u00a0*Yes*\u00a0is fundamentally shaped and tied together by the lines that it otherwise seems to disavow.\n\nIn short: Swiss\u00a0cheese cannot be thought apart from its holes. Pretty good book, 4\/5.\n\nYES IS A PLEASANT COUNTRY\n\nyes is a pleasant country:  \nif's wintry  \n(my lovely)  \nlet's open the year\n\nboth is the very weather  \n(not either)  \nmy treasure,  \nwhen violets appear\n\nlove is a deeper season  \nthan reason;  \nmy sweet one  \n(and april's where we're)"}

{"prompt":"Thoughts on Orlando by Virginia Woolf ( it\u2019s one of my favourite books so I\u2019d love to hear what others think about literally any aspect of it!)","response":"For me, the best aspect of this book is how it balances such a grand sweeping journey across personal, social and literary history with a celebration of the everyday. To my mind, the quotidian is the strongest theme across the story. \n\nOrlando led a frivolous and unsatisfactory life as a young man, focusing on either momentary pleasure or abstract ambition rather than immersing in the present moment. Then I feel the transition scene where Orlando becomes a woman is really interesting viewed through this lens because:\n\na) becoming a woman implicitly saved Orlando\u2019s life by allowing her to escape the uprising. Her life was saved just at the moment where life as a diplomat had started to lose any sort of lustre and they were starting to reevaluate their path. Therefore, just when Orlando was on the cusp of realising the value and potential fulfilment in ordinary days, their life was almost cut short. However, they deserved to have it saved so this realisation could come to full bloom.\n\nb) The domestic sphere was typically viewed as the space of women, and mundane quotidian activities fell in this domain. Therefore, in becoming a woman, Orlando entered a space where recognising the value of day to day life was part of the status quo. Woolf was very revolutionary in framing Orlando\u2019s following existence as a woman as affording more opportunity for growth, development and fulfilment than a largely shallow unfulfilled life as a man as Orlando matured across the centuries. \n\nThen THE TOY BOAT SCENE. Life, day to day life, is equated to ecstasy! Possibly my favourite literary passage, to the point where I am going to get a toy boat tattoo someday! \n\nThe whole story is so immersive I felt I experienced it right alongside Orlando and was deeply involved with their emotional subjectivity. Therefore, the ending was incredibly satisfying and powerful in how it set us up to reflect back on Orlando\u2019s life \u2014 a life made up of both historical moments and day to day experiences \u2014 alongside them. I cried the first time I read it!\n\nJust an all up beautiful book!"}

{"prompt":"Thoughts on speed reading","response":"Hello there,\n\nI often use speed-reading techniques for non-fiction (mostly work-related documentation and emails) , but they don\u2019t seem to work as well when it comes to literature.

While reading non-fiction, you can easily read 500\u2013600 words per minute and trade off the enjoyment factor because... the main point is to get the information, right?\n\nIf I read a novel, though, I find that letting my mind wander and reading paragraphs two, three, four times is part of the process.

I\u2019m glad that most of you agree speed reading just isn\u2019t worth it for literature.

Would speed reading be applicable in this case, so you don\u2019t completely lose your 100-page time investment without finishing the book?"}

{"prompt":"The lifeboat scene in *Auggie March* by Saul Bellow","response":"If you haven't read *The Adventures of Auggie March* by Saul Bellow maybe you should. I'm willing to recommend it at least. It's got this scene near the end I think I've actually been thinking about more or less the past 20 years at this point. Does anyone else think about the lifeboat scene in *Auggie March*?\n\nTo me, the narrative is structured like a non- *Moby Dick* Herman Melville novel like *Redburn* or *Pierre* where things just happen involving the protagonist independent of usual narrative tropes like agency or fate or antagonistic conflict -- I mean, I guess plot is sorta a more modern contrivence anyway, like if you think of *Pamela* by Samuel Richardson or *The Pilgrim's Progress* by John Bunyan they're sorta like that too, but that's maybe why to me the structure of *Auggie March* as more or less a contemporary novel, comparitavely, seems to me at least to maybe probably be like a big part of what I read as what Saul Bellow was tryna do by making the book.\n\nThe protagonist spends the book bopping around in this drifter sorta lifestyle getting into different situations, occasionally refusing to participate in conversations about one's life needing to have a specific direction until this lifeboat scene which is written totally differently, different tone, different syntax, with a narrarive closeness that to me seemed like implied you're supposed to really pay attention to that part. But that chapter is sorta goofy as fuck right?\n\nI mean obviously at the end of it you can tell the other guy's gone crazy from dehydration and probably sepsis, but before that the stuff he's saying is sorta portayed as like an actual interpretation of the reality of the story. To me, it doesn't seem like that part is supposed to be discredited entirely, and if so it's the only part of the book that departs from reality itself. Like for the sake of the book, it's not not true that this guy really is an important biologist and he really has discovered that the origin of life originates in some chemical representation of the concept of \"boredom\". I mean, obviously this is meant to be a metaphor of a major theme of the story; it'd be obtuse not to recognize that.\n\nI've not read anything else by Saul Bellow, so maybe it's not unusual for him to boil down a narrative theme by suddenly introducing pretty much a sci-fi element, but that is actually a pretty an unusual thing in general to do in a novel.\n\nDid anyone else read this differently? For me, what I think he was tryna do worked, like, make you think about the relationship between boredom and life itself in ultimately a spiritual kinda way. Like I think about that chapter whenever I'm bored, like for the past 20 years.\n\nI've never talked to anyone else who's even read this book since the English teacher who recommended it for some reason and maybe I never will. I'm talking about an author who was well known at his time, but forgetten pretty quickly after.

{"prompt":"Men Without Women : On Vulnerability and Longing","response":"Men Without Women : Murakami \n\n\nAs a man, the book forced me to think deeply about each of the stories. I reflected on each story and found threads that were relatable. They are a cry highlighting the lost significance of women in men's lives, finally culminating in the last story, which serves more as an epilogue or essay, binding all the previous stories into one common thread to reflect on the overall theme of the book. I really liked the book. I felt each story was distinctly unique and refreshing. While they might have a consistent theme, each felt different enough, picking up on distinct aspects of male fragility and vulnerability in relation to women.\n\n\u201cThe Independent Organ\u201d beautifully explores desirability, limerence, and the need for genuine affection. \u201cYesterday\u201d reflects on holding on or letting go, incompatibility in commitment, and the chains that bind. \u201cDrive My Car\u201d is very emotionally rich and explores the hidden depth of what one seeks in relationships, platonic or otherwise, the hidden depths of understanding another's emotions in totality and the complexities of love, the many partnerships and agreements one forms, and the vulnerability that comes with them. \u201cScheherazade,\u201d a very peculiar story, reflects on affection, limerence, and the need for companionship with the other gender, even if not love in particular. \u201cSamsa in Love\u201d explores the rawness of affection between men and women, laying bare the effects of social upbringing and reflecting on how it is biologically intertwined in first principles. \u201cKino\u201d stands out; each paragraph is deeper and richer than the last, with emotions formed by the prose, extensive metaphors, and literary themes exploring the importance of honesty in accepting one's feelings.\n\nI must add, though, that man is not the exclusive subject of the book. The book tries to balance this by identifying women's emotions and their vulnerability towards men, as reflected in \u201cYesterday\u201d and even in \u201cScheherazade.\u201d The epilogue, though from the perspective of men, shows the importance of the void waiting to be filled by the opposite gender. The psychology of love and companionship is very complex, and the book tries to do justice to that by picking some threads and exploring them in different stories.\n\nHighly recommended (4.5\/5)."}

The list currently has about 80 books, which is not a lot considering. \n\nMy question is, i guess, what do you consider must reads, which books are considered classics but no one actually reads, and what do you think should be in the UNIVERSAL literature list.\n\nThat said, i would like to point out a couple of observations about what we already have. Most of what we could think of (about 2\/3) is English and North American literature, and the second most used language on our list is Russian (tho its mostly Tolstoy and Dostoevsky). The rest is pretty much exclusively European (Goethe for German, Albert Camus, Victor Hugo, Flauvert, Verne etc for french, Ibsen and Knut Hamsun for Norwegian... you get the gist). The only South American I've got is Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. Africa and South Asia are nowhere to be seen. While I know our ingorance can't be blamed exclusively on the education system, i still believe our surroundings and upbringing has played a significant part in this. and i think we're on the intellectual side of the spectrum, so people around us are not better.\n\nThe time period isn't very diverse either. Aside from some ancient greek classics likw Homer and Sophocles, the oldest thing in th list is The Divine Comedy followed by Utopia. Then it goes on to Shakespeare and after that its pretty much 19th century.\n\nThis is not to say I wouldnt like English suggestions (i would appreciate the most famous classics as well), and in fact, i have found myself rather favoring them. But i have realized that and i think its a problem that that is what comes to mind and hope to get other ideas as well.\n\nSorry if this has turned into a weird rant instead of the original question lmao. hope what i said makes sense"}

{"prompt":"I'm beginning to think Epic Fantasy and Medieval Fantasy were a Mistake","response":"Hi. Is it just me who thinks the epic fantasy and medieval fantasy genres were a mistake? It seems like any adventures which do not featue the most otherworldly, awe-inspiring, and often stereotypical elements of fantasy fiction get relegated to the sidelines. Due to a kind of herd effect, it feels like when someone says they're into reading, it wouldn't be a terrible gamble to assume they're either into some kind of fantasy, or romance, or crime thriller which centres around murder. I'm sick of hearing about dragons, elves, orcs, dwarves, wizards with grey beards, and any other remodelling of Lord of the Rings. If it lacks one thing, it usually has another. And it isn't enough to just swap out orcs for, say, naga or some other obscure fictional species if the role is basically the same, if your monsters or magic are massively dominant parts of the fictional world. Whatever happened to an adventure to a long lost island? Or journeying deep under the earth? Or coming into contact with a secret order who exist despite the modern world? Or maybe even something with more an obscure metaphysical\/philosophical thing that isn't as flashy as we're used to with fantasy? *Flashy* is perhaps precisely what fantasy has come to mean! Look at the front covers! Big battles, big swords, big breasts, big orcs and ogres, big castles and shinning cities... Wands, staffs, fireballs, etc. Do fantasy writers lack self-awareness? Do they not think, 'Gee, this has been done a million times before'? No pride? 'Gee, why don't I create another copy-paste, overdone fictional setting!' And, no, swapping out a medieval aesthetic for, say, a Chinese or Arabic one doesn't change things much. And once it's done, then it's done. We don't want 3000 more of the same.\n\nIn the past, people invented tales about magical things in their own time. Nowadays, a lot of fantasy writers write about little but the Middle Ages. It's bizarre.\n\nIt's all so tedious as f\\*ck and mightily uninventive at this point. It has not subtlety to it either. I kind of feel like epic\/medieval fantasy is the p\\*rn of literature. Once you've consumed enough of it, everything else can appear bland, too banal, even not imaginative enough.\n\nThe same could perhaps be said of sci-fi with its tedious galactic empires squabbling over the endless blackness of empty space, which frankly is a very unappetising vision of the future.\n\nAnd I imagine romance can be cliched and tedious as hell, and I personally find crime thrillers to be fairly copy-paste. But at least they're somewhat real, if that's a redeeming virtue.\n\nI just can't help but think that if most of the epic\/medieval fantasy stuff disappeared tomorrow we'd have more of other stuff. Or maybe some other cr\\*p, cliched genre would replace it. Maybe this is what ease of publishing does to literature, and so most will never be 'classics', just noise.\n\nOf course, the same can be said of films, TV series, video games, and maybe even music. But let's keep the scope narrow.\n\nOf course, people will disagree with this. I just feel like epic\/medieval fantasy is dominating too much of our literary space, and maybe therefore a lot of readers are missing out on other stuff because it isn't mind-blowing enough as all the exaggerated stuff that epic\/medieval fantasy typically embodies."}

{"prompt":"Almond is a great book. Trust me.","response":"What does love mean?\u201d Mom asked mischievously. \u201cTo discover beauty.\u201d\n-Sohn Won Pyung\n\nIt\u2019s strange how we don\u2019t know how important our emotions are to our complicated lives. Have you ever pondered what life may be like if we were incapable of experiencing these emotions? In a world where our hearts and these feelings are the only things controlling our bodies. Would things be the same?\n\n\nThese emotions in these moments refine in a way that we rarely acknowledge. Imagine a world where emotions like Joy, Fear and Sorrow were not known and there was no away to truly express what you feel and carrying that strange feeling inside of you like a unwillingly given burden with no escape because in order to move on, you must understand why you felt what you did and why you no longer need to feel it.\n\n\u201cMaybe understanding a language is like understanding the expressions and emotions of other people.\u201d -Sohn Won Pyung\n\nThis perspective compels us to think about how we handle life and how we perceive emotions. We frequently believe that emotions are expressed and understood by everyone, yet this is not at all the case.\n\nSome people have trouble understanding emotions because of the way their minds are designed, not because they are careless. Instead of relying on intuition and emotion, they view the world through the prisms of observation and reasoning.\n\nHowever, their sensations of connection, love, and longing are just as intense, and I feel sorry for individuals who are unable to feel or comprehend the true meaning of anything.\n\nIt is in this exploration that we begin to appreciate the beauty of human differences. We learn to value the capacity for intense emotion while also honouring others who have more subdued, gentler ways of experiencing the world. We come to see that understanding can exist outside of words, that kindness is not always spoken, and that love is not always loud.\n\n\u201cFrom what I understood, love was an extreme idea. A word that seemed to force something undefinable into the prison of letters. But the word was used so easily, so often. People spoke of love so casually, just to mean the slightest pleasure or thanks.\u201d -Almond by Sohn Won-Pyung\n\nSohn Won-pyung\u2019s \u201cAlmond\u201d centres on Yunjae, a young child who was born with alexithymia, a disorder that impairs his ability to sense and communicate emotions.\n\nHe is brought up by his mother and grandmother, who educate him how to live in the world. But when a tragedy hits, Yunjae is forced to face a world that does not comprehend him. He is forced to take on road where he understands that emotions can be understood beyond words.\n\nThis change in viewpoint is what gives Almond its potent reading experience. It narrates the tale of a youngster with a neurological disorder who finds it difficult to understand emotions, yet his journey reveals the intricacies of interpersonal relationships in profoundly meaningful ways.\n\nHis eyes serve as a reminder that empathy and affection are characterised by their silent persistence rather than their outward manifestation.\n\nIt\u2019s extremely easy to read, yet it has an effect on you that will change your feelings forever.\n\nThe reader may put themselves in the protagonist\u2019s shoes and experience his world firsthand thanks to the straightforward yet profoundly touching style, which also helps us comprehend what it really means to \u201cfeel.\u201d\n\nSometimes, all it takes to change the way we see the world is a story that shows us another way to live. Almond is one such story, subtle yet profound, simple yet transformative. If you\u2019re looking for a novel that will challenge your perception of emotions and human connection, Almond is a book that should not be missed."}

{"prompt":"Cormac McCarthy: beauty and simplicity","response":"\"Once there were brook trouts in the streams in the mountains. You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.\"\n\nAfter many pages of hopelessness and abyss, The Road opens up in its very final paragraph. Sometimes this quote pops into my mind and I think of the things I can't put back and the things I cannot make right again. The past always seems simple when one is in the future, but simplicity is also inherent to life.\n\nThis is the entire concept of Cormac McCarthy's bibliography: complexity from simplicity. How a sentence in his books can seemingly spin a new world and conjure unbelievable images without the use of punctuation, or in fact much standard writing rules. I struggle to call his books novels, they are closer to poems written in prose, in my opinion.\n\nRest in peace to the greatest author, the author who dared to break every rule and create his own world, who moved my perception of literature so far and who changed my life in so many ways.

{"prompt":"Morning Star- A tedious AND hypnotic work","response":"If one tries to count some of the (living and working) international literary figures who might be considered an entire establishment at this point in history Knausgaard has to be there. His My Struggle series is already a favourite of countless modern writers and also the point of scorn of many ,not to mention the countless million copies they have sold; very few serious non-english literary fiction writers have found such commercial and critical attention.\n\nFigures like Zadie Smith and James Wood consider him to be one of the most compelling writers of his time. While some people think that he is the most boring writer who has ever lived.\n\nI haven't read My Struggle but, after finishing The First book of his \"Morgenstjernen\" series I think both are true.\n\nThe best way I could describe Morning Star is to compare it to two russian writers I greatly admire. One is Dostoevsky and the other is Chekov.\n\nThe best way I could describe it is that Knausgaard has the same psychological and philosophical concerns as Dostoevsky but with the same astute observations about the everyday tragedy and comedy as Chekov. Except I have never found that much mundane descriptions in any Chekov story. The only writer I have read who is so preoccupied with the mundane is probably Haruki Murakami (I also have the same criticisms against him) and even then I am not sure if he is as mundane as him. The amount of time I felt that this book mentioned every minute detail about some character's laundry habits and the state of their underwear is certainly frustrating but simultaneously compelling and hypnotic for some reason. I think the best way I could say that Knausgaard's style works is because how conversational his writing is(atleast in this book). The book is entirely comprised of first person narrators in the span of two days. All of them are struggling with some sort of crises while a strange star appears in the sky and some really weird and fantastic stuff starts to happen around them(I don't want to spoil the plot too much)\n\nThe best chapters were Egil's and Arne's they bounced back eachother on pretty interesting ways. The chapter of Jostein where he investigates a very gruesome and graphic murder was very interesting. Turid's chapters were pretty insane(again I really don't want to spoil).\n\nI personally hated Iselin's chapters. I really think that he wasn't the best in writing a gen z character.(The part where she says she listened to bad guy by Billie Eilish and it made her want to just go out and fuck everything almost made me throw the book outside of my window)\n\nThe supernatural or magical realism or fantasy elements of this book are very very subtle untill the very end until when it suddenly explodes and in the penultimate chapter it almost turns into a full blown fantasy story. Yet the heart of the book lies on the very human struggles and problems of their characters and the philosophical questions it is posing. At its heart Morning Star is completely a novel of ideas. And the main idea it is concerned with is what happens in a world, which has pretty much abandoned the Christian or spiritual roots of itself and is pretty much only concerned with the palpable and with the now. How could one find a chance of transcendence in a society like that in a world where every symbol has started to lose it's meaning. The other idea is death and.....you know I don't want to spoil it because it's really tied with the plot.\n\nThe Morning Star leaves a lingering after taste and a lot of question which are never answered. Will they get an answer in it's sequels? I don't know. I plan to eventually read them. But not now, because I don't have any money to buy new books and also I think I really should take a break from Knausgaard for some time before returning to his world.\n\nOverall I think Morning Star is a flawed and great but not too difficult challenge which is great for fans of anyone who is interested in more philosophical side of fiction."}

I\u2019ve been thinking about this book for a couple days now, and I still haven\u2019t quite determined how I feel about it. \n\nKeiko\u2019s struggle to fit in and belong in society is very sympathetic, and her off beat commentary can be amusing. That said, I struggle to call the book \u201cheartwarming\u201d, as I see many reviews do. \n\n**The Climax**\n\nKeiko spends much of the book trying to appease her friends, family, and \u201csociety\u201d. She wears the same clothes that her coworker does, she intentionally talks the same way that they do, etc. This effort to be \u201cnormal\u201d and blend in culminates in her getting a boyfriend\u2014an incel who leeches off her for food and board.

Her attitude towards the store is aptly compared to religious worship; each cell of her body is said to be composed of the store.

{"prompt":"My year of rest and relaxation","response":"I put this under criticism but I really just wanted to know what other people on this sub think about my year of rest and relaxation by ottessa moshfegh. I personally really liked the book and it somewhat reminded me of Sylvia plath\u2019s bell jar. Both had pretty \u201cdislikable\u201d but ultimately relatable narrators who struggled with their mental health throughout the novel. I\u2019m aware that The Bell Jar is considered a classic and wonder if in due time My Year Of Rest And Relaxation could see the-same recognition? What do the rest of you think?\n\nI personally think it could be considered a contemporary classic, it had such a specific feel to it that I\u2019ve yet to see another book replicate. The book may come off tedious and boring to some, but its exactly that slow, lifeless, expressionless and dull narrative that makes the book so good. The author creates a narrator whose life consumes your own. When reading the book it\u2019s almost like you are drowning with the main character. Her indifference, her depersonalization, the disruption of time, everything she feels you will feel also. She\u2019s blatantly depressed, you can tell even though she hasn\u2019t mentioned it once. I\u2019ll add an excerpt from a goodreads reveiw I wrote in response to someone\u2019s pretty shallow criticism of the book, \n\n\u201cThe main character is rich yes, but not as rich as you seem to believe. She had lost her mother and has only one friend. She lives alone and has no meaningful relationships in her life. She has no passion and no motivation, She\u2019s alive but she\u2019s dead. She skips from day to day and nothing changes for her. She lives in a constant state of dissociation and boredom and at that point money cannot save her. She is a good written example of someone who is suicidal but not willing to commit to the act. If you read between the lines its easy to see that she does not care for her life\u2014 in fact, she wants out. The point of the story is to show how she escaped her perceivably bleak reality. Shes in a constant battle with a \u201ctiredness\u201d that isn\u2019t physical. Mentally she\u2019s melting away, and she struggles to continue her life. She (without realizing it herself) wants to die, or at the very least opt out of her existence. Her being a \u201cbad person\u201d and \u201cunlikable\u201d really only adds to the narrative. The whole point of the character is that she does not care, she doesn\u2019t care about her friends, she doesn\u2019t care about herself and she certainly does not care about what the audience or the reader will think. Her life is empty and she is too, her relationships are vapid just like her and so is her speech. She lives in new york city during the 2000s, which just further plays into her entire character and the narrative. Shallow girl surrounded by shallow people, her world is hollow and so is she. The fact that it inspired such strong feelings in you is in my opinion a sign that this is after all a good book, or at the very least worth talking about\u201d\n\nI added this because i believe it helps explain my perspective on the character, I ended off the comment with \u201cat the very least worth talking about\u201d because the woman I was replying to shared her very strong feelings of hate towards the character and her \u201crich girl\u201d syndrome, claiming she was vapid, boring and stupid. She ended off by saying the book was a waste of time, yet I personally believe that any novel that could stir up so much emotion in another person is worthy of discussion and recognition. There are objectively bad books, and many people love them. That doesn\u2019t make them good books. There are also objectively good books, and many people hate them. That doesn\u2019t make them bad books. I believe My Year of Rest and Relaxation to be an objectively good book with good writing and although it had a pretty loose plot it was reflective of the author\u2019s personal style of writing. It felt like a memory in my mind with no start and no finish once I put the book down. It felt less like a story and more like an experience. \n\nanyways, what do the rest of you think?"}

It masterfully blends rigorous history with narrative power, characterization, and poignant drama, making it a cornerstone of Chinese literature as much as historiography.\n\nI wanted to share one particularly moving excerpt that exemplifies this unique blend \u2013 the heartbreaking story of Li Si's final moments. Its literary power, even in Chinese, is immense, and I hope a good translation can convey some of that. Below is the original Classical Chinese text from Sh\u01d0 J\u00ec, followed by my attempt at an English translation:\n\n**\u200b\u200b\\[Original Chinese Text\\]\u200b\u200b**\n\n\u201c\u65af\u51fa\u72f1\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4e2d\u5b50\u4ff1\u6267\u3002\u987e\u8c13\u5176\u4e2d\u5b50\u66f0\uff1a\u2018\u543e\u6b32\u4e0e\u82e5\u590d\u7275\u9ec4\u72ac\uff0c\u4ff1\u51fa\u4e0a\u8521\u4e1c\u95e8\u9010\u72e1\u5154\uff0c\u5c82\u53ef\u5f97\u4e4e\uff01\u2019\u9042\u7236\u5b50\u76f8\u54ed\uff0c\u800c\u5937\u4e09\u65cf\u3002\u201d\n\n\u200b\u200b**\\[English Translation\\]\u200b\u200b**\n\n\"Li Si was taken out of prison, bound together with his middle son. He turned to his son and said: 'I long to once more walk with you, leading our yellow hound, out through the East Gate of Shangcai to chase after crafty hares. But how could that ever be possible again?' At this, father and son burst into tears. Li Si and his three generations of kin were then executed.\"\n\n\n\nMy thoughts on this passage: \u200bThe wish to simply \"lead the yellow hound and chase the crafty hare\" seems such a humble, ordinary desire.\u200b\u200b Yet it\u2019s the dying wish of \u200bLi Si \u2013 the Chancellor of the Empire, a man who wielded immense power.\u200b\u200b That juxtaposition \u2013 between the pastoral simplicity of the wish and the grim reality of his imminent, brutal execution \u2013 is absolutely heart-wrenching. \u200bIt\u2019s precisely this stark contrast, masterfully drawn by Sima Qian in just a few lines, that creates such profound and devastating literary sorrow.\u200b\u200b The sheer emotional potency of this scene lies not just in the fate of the characters, but in how brilliantly it exposes the ultimate fragility of human ambition and the universality of regret when faced with finality."}

{"prompt":"Just finished Blood Meridian and I do not understand all of the praise it gets.","response":"First of all the, story doesn\u2019t really have a plot, which I know is intentional; however, the lack of plot combined with the prose used by McCarthy made me want to put the book down. Everyone raves about his writing style, but I find it clunky and ambiguous, especially with dialogue. Is it really necessary to use \u201cand\u201d sixteen times in one sentence instead of commas or semicolons? \n\nFurthermore, I feel like much of the commentary on good and evil in the book could have just been an essay by McCarthy. It seems to me that the judge is a vessel for McCarthy to get across what he wanted to say about being complacent in evil acts or joining in them, and I didn\u2019t need to read 350 pages of landscapes being described to have those questions posed to me.\n\nOne thing I do like is that the book makes you familiar with the slaughter of humans to the point where murder is negligible, and then poses a different kind of violence which makes you question why one act seemed okay in your head and the other did not. I\u2019m thinking of when Glanton(?) chucked two puppies in a river. \n\nNot knowing Spanish was also very detrimental my read of the book. Stopping to translate words, sentences, and conversations so often took a lot out of the experience for me.\n\nNote that this was my first Cormac McCarthy book I read and I did go in blind. Also, I\u2019m coming off of reading works by authors like Lovecraft and Ursula K. LeGuin who love their punctuation, so perhaps I\u2019m finding the switch extra jarring. I also will admit that a portion of the commentary likely went over my head.\n\nI would love to have my mind changed; I read a couple other discussions about this book on this sub and they were not able to do so."}

{"prompt":"My negative review of Wuthering Heights.","response":"I\u2019m aware that the overwhelming majority of people find this novel to be an untouchable classic with some of the best prose in English literature. Here\u2019s, in short, why I disagree.\n\nFor me, this book was too steeped in dated language and circumstances to enjoy beyond reading it for cultural education. The predictable heart-on-sleeve melodrama Bront\u00eb employs in her character description and action just doesn\u2019t do it for me. \u201cWithout delay I flung myself to the floor, and hence ejaculated a cry from my breast that shook the very foundations of the apartment.\u201d Ugh. Every sentence is like that. I just made that up, it\u2019s not even in the book.\n\nLook, I understand that I\u2019m reading something that\u2019s 150 years old, I do, and I can approach reading it from that perspective. But even contextually speaking I can\u2019t get behind the consensus that this is some of the most beautiful writing in literature. I simply disagree. It reads like many other texts of that time. There\u2019s an evocative description of nature every once in a while, sure. To me, however, on the whole, it\u2019s not particularly beautiful writing. It\u2019s just\u2026formal. It\u2019s English. I wasn\u2019t often moved by its words, or transported into its world. The prose did not inspire me.\n\nI felt like I was being told a self-indulgent story about a self-destructive family. It felt like someone was reading me an old play. Or reading from a dry journal. All emotions explained, nothing left to the imagination, all action described plainly and obviously. It was okay. It was fine. But I would never recommend this book to anyone.\n\nLong story short, the fact that this may have been groundbreaking for its time does not, in my opinion, make it an object of quality today. The prose feels stiff, antiquated, overly expositional, and it\u2019s difficult to feel for any of the characters as a result. Subtlety and nuance and structure and syntax has evolved tremendously since the mid-1800s. While there are some older books that very much succeed to this day from a stylistic standpoint, this one just isn\u2019t it.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEDIT: Clearly I didn\u2019t articulate the depth of my thoughts clearly enough, which is my fault. On rereading my critique I can see that I really only laid blame on the language, which is not entirely what I meant to do. The language only played a part in my larger problem with the book, which was that I wasn\u2019t properly made to feel for these characters. And to be clear, I am not one of these types that needs to sympathize with characters in order to enjoy a book. I love reading about despicable people. But I do expect to be drawn into the world, to be made to feel as though I\u2019m living in their misery. And Bront\u00eb\u2019s writing didn\u2019t do that for me. It kept me at a distance.\n\nPart of that may have to do with her choice of having Mrs. Dean recount word for word the entire sequence of events, from a distance, to a stranger, after the fact. Part of it may have to do with me not responding particularly well to melodrama. Either way, I wasn\u2019t immersed. The Earnshaws\u2019 and the Lintons\u2019 tortured relationships didn\u2019t feel urgent, immediate, or real to me. I always felt one step removed. And it\u2019s a shame because I can see an intense and gratifying story there. Anyway, that\u2019s my two more cents."}

{"prompt":"Thoughts on the pratagonist of The Stranger, by Albert Camus?","response":"I just finished reading The Stranger, by Albert Camus. \n\nI haven't read anything else by or about Camus (other than a quick glance over his wikipedia page). \n\nWhen reading, I used to try and think \"what is the author trying to say here?\" Or \"how is the author trying to make me think about this character?\" But now I just dismiss the author's intentions and jump on board for the ride. With that in mind, here is my take on Mersault, which probably differs from how the author saw him.\n\nI totally understand the feelings of disconnection that Mersault experiences. The existentialist pang of \"what does it matter anyway\". In my low moments, it's a nihilistic attitude that leads to a depressive view if my life. On the other side, it can reduce (almost) any suffering or inconcenience to a shrug of the shoulders and a smiling \"c'est la vie\". It also makes me deeply appreciate small moments, like Mersault does when he's at the beach and with his lover. \n\nSo I understand all that and I also understand his refusal fit some social norms and conventions. \n\nTaken as a cardboard cut out designed to show Camus' personal philosophy in some parable, I like Mersault. But taken as an autonomous character who is supposed to be a real person living in an actual world of other people, I think he's a boring psychopath. He has no motivation in life beyond \"exist\" and \"maybe enjoy some pleasant sensations if they're easily attainable.\" But he doesn't show the even the smallest amount of remorse for cold-bloodidly executing a man. Sure, he had no particular desire to kill the man. But his actions were deliberate and remorseless. This lack of empathy is deliberately shown as part of his \"nothing matters anyway\" attitude to life. It's a continuation of his lack of empathy towards a woman beaing beaten by her ex-boyfriend (Raymon).\n\nBut I dislike Mersault. Is he supposed to be an anti-hero of sorts? If I knew him as a person, I'd dislike him. He is completely self-absorbed. Doesn't give a single shit about the feelings of a woman who is besotted by him and he just floats through life being pushed around by circumstance and having zero regard for anyone he encounters. \n\nWhat's your take on him? Are we supposed to view him like this, or are we supposed to think he's some ideal person?\n\nAlso, I did like his chat with the priest at the end and I get his argument from a logical\/rational point of view. But his lack of humanity makes me dislike him."}

{"prompt":"What I think Lord of the Rings is about","response":"After reading Lord Of The Rings, I believe that there is an allegory or some kind of symbolism about the world that we live in today. If you read Plato's Republic, book 2, they talk about the biggest theme of the whole dialogue which is justice. In the dialogue, the characters talk about the ring of gyges, which is a ring that gives immense power and turns the wearer invisible. The wearer of the ring of gyges uses the power to kill the king, marry the queen and takes over the kingdom.\n\nNow this is where my theory comes in. I am 100% sure that Tolkien was inspired by this dialogue, hence the invisible ring.\n\nMiddle Earth represents our own. The Hobbits are children\/very young adults. They are happy go lucky, sing songs, play, party, walk barefoot. And the world does not pay attention to them other than Gandalf. The adults are the men, dwarves, elves etc.\n\nThe Hobbits live in a sheltered world, similar to how growing up as a child you are sheltered from the world and you don't know what's going on. \n\nThese things could be the reason why Hobbits are the only people that could have destroyed the ring, but they are not 100% immune to it, because Frodo almost did not want to destroy the ring because of its immense power which he understood. That's why Boromir wanted to use the ring because the 'adults' understand it's power to a certain degree. And Tolkien wants to show that this immense power can corrupt you to your soul. To the point where you become unrecognizable (Gollum). \n\nGollum is an interesting character because he was also a Hobbit and obviously my theory of Hobbits being the only people to be able to destroy it can be argued because of Gollum's story.\n\nIf anyone wants me to expand on this please feel free  to ask or challenge my views. I have always thought about this since I have read LOTR. I know that Tolkien says that it's free from allegory but, that's what makes books great. We all get a different perspective."}

{"prompt":"All Art is not Political.","response":"I constantly see the opinion online that all literature, and all art for that matter, is inherently political. Which seems to mean that because all art comes about in the world, and politics are everywhere in the world, that politics is bound to be a relevant factor in all art. I think this is nonsense. If an artist chooses, and states that he is choosing,  to affect a political or didactic message ,e.g. Shelley, then yes, we apply a political analysis. But if the artist has explicitly stated that they are simply not interested in that sort of thing, regardless of their supposed privilege e.g. Nabokov, Keats, then I think it is a total waste of time to speculate on what politics might have to do with it, or to try and cram and pigeon hole the work into some bandy political framework. If we happen to be ignorant of the artists personal politics e.g. Shakespeare, then trying to infer what their politics must have been by how they wrote is a silly exercise, which usually amounts to the reader following his own footprint. \n\nI see people who make these statements almost invariably making everything about class and privilege, which usually doesn\u2019t have the artist coming out looking favourably. \n\nTo anyone who disagrees with me, I set you this challenge. Explain to me how John Keats\u2019 Ode to a Nightingale is a political poem. \n\nA note in anticipation. Answers such as: \u2018John Keats expresses what we can safely interpret as suicidal tendencies. Mental health was not what it is today back in Keats\u2019 time, so the anguish he feels is a direct result of the absence of government institutions to treat his ailment.\u2019 Or \u2018John Keats wants to consume alcohol to numb his pain. Alcohol was a big part of English culture, and was prescribed as a remedy for sorrow. This is a direct consequence of the political environment.\u2019 Do not meet my standard.

{"prompt":"Wuthering Heights","response":"So I recently finished reading wuthering heights and can truly without a doubt say it's one of the  best literary classics I have read. I  am curious about opinions regarding certain characters . Was heathcliff  truly evil and malicious in the way he treated the other characters, or was he just trying to navigate through his childhood trauma?  Another character that I also  want to analyse is Hindley. Was he too pure evil after the death of his wife or was he also just lost? Furthermore, can all characters be understood and justified in their actions just because of their past experiences?"}
{"prompt":"Wuthering Heights","response":"I feel like everyone in this story is evil, but not for evils sake like movie villains, but because they're all selfish, unsympathetic, and emotionally stunted. Every conflict in the book would've been more or less prevented if the characters had an ounce of empathy for one another."}
{"prompt":"Wuthering Heights","response":"I think characters can be understood, but I don\u2019t think their trauma justifies their bad actions. They still did those bad things."}
{"prompt":"Wuthering Heights","response":"Emily Bronte really could have diversified the character names though, that was an annoying part of the book. That being said, I also think Charlotte is a better writer."}
{"prompt":"1984 vs Brave New World: Which Dystopia Did We Actually End Up In?","response":"So I was watching this video analyzing dystopian fiction, and he brought up the point that when most people talk about dystopia, the first names that come up are usually Orwell\u2019s *1984* and Bradbury\u2019s *Fahrenheit 451*. And for good reason\u2014they\u2019re classics that warn us about authoritarianism, censorship, and the dangers of losing our freedoms.\n\nBut the more I revisit Aldous Huxley\u2019s *Brave New World*, or watch videos like this one, the more I feel it might be **the most accurate dystopian book ever written**\u2014maybe even more relevant than Orwell\u2019s. Instead of oppression through fear and force, Huxley shows a world where control comes through pleasure, distraction, and moral degradation. No Big Brother, no Thought Police\u2014just **comfort as a weapon**. For Example,\n\n* Happiness = stability, even if it means losing individuality.\n* Science replaces love, family, and even human reproduction.\n* Conditioning and drugs (hello, Soma) keep everyone \u201ccontent.\u201d\n* Morality becomes a moving target\u2014sound familiar in today\u2019s world?\n\nIt raises some huge questions:\n\n* Is the pursuit of *comfort* more dangerous than the threat of *control*?\n* Does technological progress automatically equal human progress?\n\nEveryone usually says that we're living in 1984, but I really think that it's more accurate to say that we're living in a Huxleyan world of pleasure and mechanised self-slavery (in my opinion). What do you guys think?"}
{"prompt":"1984 vs Brave New World: Which Dystopia Did We Actually End Up In?","response":"yes I read 1984 and BNW quite close to each other and although I preferred 1984 as a book I definitely felt like BNW more accurately reflected the current western world. Ending is better than Mending foreshadowing our current disposable culture, for one thing you haven\u2019t mentioned."}

{"prompt":"Was H.P. Lovecraft not that good at writing, or do I just need to read more?","response":"Everything else about the man aside, I am unsure if Lovecraft was even that good at writing. I understand that his works basically founded a subgenre of horror \u2013 that part is undeniable, and I think he was at least very creative \u2013 but I am somehow unconvinced of his actual writing skill. I just today read \"Cold Air\", and it was... disappointing, to say the least. I normally love those kinds of stories, but I did not feel anything at all from this particular work. No wonder, no dread, not even that must interest. Frankly, I only read past the first few paragraphs because I thought it would get better, but it did not, and the final \"twist\" was at least decent, but not \"this made a genre\" good. His wording, his patterns, all of them were okay, but nothing special, nothing great. It did not even compare to, say, Crime and Punishment or even Frankenstein.\nI am wondering now whether or not that was just because of the unrealistic premise of the story or because I essentially had the ending spoiled to me. I am normally okay with suspension of disbelief, and knowing the ending does not typically entirely ruin a story, but I am unsure.\nDoes anybody have any strong opinions on this, one way or another? \"Cold Air\" is the only work of his which I have read, so maybe it was a fluke...?"}
{"prompt":"Was H.P. Lovecraft not that good at writing, or do I just need to read more?","response":"Why do you say \u201cit\u2019s not EVEN as good as crime and punishment.\u201d Crime and punishment is a timeless classic."}
{"prompt":"Was H.P. Lovecraft not that good at writing, or do I just need to read more?","response":"I think you\u2019re going in with odd expectations of Lovecraft. He was a pulp writer, and I don\u2019t mean that disparagingly, but you compared him to Dostoevsky in the same sentence. There are certainly stronger, more significant prose writers than Lovecraft. Don\u2019t wear an cocktail dress to a bar fight."}

{"prompt":"Is McMurphy in \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d a metaphorical cuckoo bird?","response":"I was thinking about the title One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest and how it\u2019s usually explained as a reference to a nursery rhyme and \u201ccuckoo\u201d as slang for someone mentally ill.\n\nBut I think there\u2019s a deeper, possibly unintended parallel to the actual cuckoo bird, known for its brood parasitism \u2014 laying its eggs in other birds\u2019 nests so it can offload the work of parenting.\n\nIn the novel, Randle McMurphy fakes insanity to get committed to a psychiatric hospital and avoid doing hard labor in prison. That\u2019s literally him nesting in someone else\u2019s space to evade consequences, just like a cuckoo chick displacing the natural flow of a host nest.\n\nOnce inside, McMurphy becomes a disruptive presence \u2014 challenging Nurse Ratched\u2019s authority, upsetting the system, and ultimately changing the environment of the ward forever. Again, just like how a cuckoo chick often dominates or even kills the rightful chicks in the nest.\n\nI\u2019m not saying Kesey intentionally based McMurphy on the bird (he probably leaned more on the \u201ccrazy\u201d slang meaning), but thematically, the resemblance is pretty striking.\n\nAnyone else see this connection or have thoughts on other biological metaphors in the novel?"}

Everyone just wants to call themselves a bookworm but those self proclaimed bookworms haven't read a single page of real literature (and by real literature, I mean the ones that have some meaning, unlike mass produced webtoons and smut).\nI always feel this huge disconnection with my friends who have nothing else to talk about except a certain youtuber or gossip about who knocked up who in college.\nEven the books written by authors today pale in comparison to the classical literary works.

{"prompt":"Halfway through Crime and Punishment - the only thing I'm struggling with...","response":"Just as a preface, for the most part I've been loving this book. Whilst everything is progressing pretty slowly, I'm invested and want to see what happens with Raskolnikov, along with all the other side characters.\n\nMy biggest problem is represented in the chapter I just read (part 3, chapter 5) where Rodya and Porfiry have a massive debate about Rask's philosophy about essentially justifying crime. I find my interest wanders off during these ramblings that are solely there for a philosophical discussion. It just doesn't interest me. I feel stupid trying to understand it all and I get bored when what I really want is the investigator to ask questions about the murder itself (which he does at the end of the chapter) and not Rodya's own philosophy.\n\nHow does the second half of the book compare? I know this is most likely an extremely unpopular opinion here, but I really am invested in the actual plot and storylines of this book. Does it get a bit more fast paced? Or am I about to read loads of sections of debates and ramblings, whilst the drama of the story stays at a stand still?"}

{"prompt":"A Grief Observed by C.S Lewis: really gripping in its own way","response":"I wouldn't think to describe a series of journals about grief for a spouse as \"gripping\" but I started the book tonight and the first page just pulled me in and I was enthralled. I'd never stayed up this late (2:30am) just to read before, but the flow of Lewis' thoughts and the insight he brought to the vortex of emotions he was feeling made it hard for me to disengage. You get wrapped up in the vortex yourself.\n\nBecause you get so deep into the headspace of the author, focused entirely on his train of thought and his emotions and nothing else, I suppose it also felt like I was quite connected to him? I just finished the book and it felt hard to \"unstick\" myself from him because I felt almost bonded (not that I actually *was* bonded, I obviously only read about a tiny sliver of his life experience). It was like saying bye to someone you know. Not in a parasocial way -- I just mean the writing was super intimate. And that also is coming from someone who doesn't share similar beliefs to Lewis and is unfamiliar with his other work.\n\nI got a little teary at parts and when I looked up a translation of the final line it made me cry. It really is a beautiful work about something that, unfortunately, connects us all. We're so lucky to have pieces of art like this to support us, to prepare us, to make us feel at least slightly understood or less alone, to stimulate our thoughts, to engage our difficult feelings in healthy and safe ways. A hearty thank you to C.S. Lewis for keeping me company tonight and for sharing his experience with such raw honesty.\n\nIf you have any thoughts on the book I'd love to hear them.

{"prompt":"what do you think about the play Merchant of Venice ?","response":"So in case you don't know it's a shakespeare play where a rich merchant( after whom the play is named ) ,antonio (who is always sad for no reason , yes they discuss it ) lends his best friend bassanio 3000 ducats ( large sum back then )to impress a very rich now orphaned noble girl called Portia ( bassanio is also a small noble but mostly broke and living lavishly on borrowed moni)\n\nThe play's jokes are very stereotypical like when Portia and her maid cum friend nerisca are discussing her suitors. Portia tells her that she rejected the south italian because he loves his horse more , the German guy is a \" sponge\" that soaks beer , scottish bloke is coward, french man is kinda a femboy ( don't remember this well ) Englishman looks alright and seems cool but only speaks one language and Portia speaks only latin and Italian .\n\nAntonio doesn't have liquid cash atm so he borrowed the moni from a Jewish (ofc) moneylender called Shylock. Shylock is nonetheless to say a very stereotypical jew charging a insane interest, is a massive miser , very blood thirsty and hates Christians.\n\nBut he tells antonio that he wants to forget all the bad blood between them ( antonio has kicked him , spat at him publicly, called him a Jewish dog for no reason other than shylock not being a Christian) and charge no interest for the loan but only a pound of flesh as a penalty as a joke ofc. Antonio despite bassanio's warning agrees and so shylock lends them the money.\n\nBassanio throws a party before leaving and invites Shylock who tells his daughter Jessica to stay indoors . Adds that he while hates christisans and won't even eat on the same table as them, he will still go cuz he wants to help them spend his money and free stuff ( haha so funny )\n\nBut Jessica that night has already planned to steal like 2k ducats , her dead mother's jewels etc and elope with her christian lover ( bassanio's friend Lorenzo), later Shylock after finding out has a stereotypical breakdown ( sad about losing the money more than his girl) and throws a massive tantrum asking the Duke to look for her. Bassanio leaves for a fictional place called Belmont.\n\nWe also come to know that Portia can't accept a suitor or reject him on her own . He has to go to a room and choose a casket from gold , silver , lead where the correct one has her pic and if he finds that then she has to marry that lad. In order to get to choose though you have to first swear to never get married again if rejected , never reveal your choice to anyone and leave immediately or marry her if you win.\n\nA prince from morocco earlier had chose the gold one which had \"he who chooses me shall get what many men desire\" ( in old english ) and Portia is happy when the black muslim guy fails , later a random prince from aragon ( idk if it's Spanish one or fictional ) chooses silver which says \"he who chooses me shall get what he deserves\" and fails.\n\nPortia (who has seen bassanio before loves him) is elated when he comes with his sidekicks ( one named Gratiano marries Nerisca ) Portia has a song played in background with its lyrics hinting to not to judge by appearance when he is choosing ( he still does give correct reasons to reject gold and silver ones , heavily implying he would win regardless) and ofc chooses lead .They get engaged when a messenger comes and tells em that Antonio's ships sank and shylock is now gonna kill him .Antonio just wants to see his best friend cum brother last time.\n\nBassanio and the boys rush ( the girls ofc stay back) and offer shylock 9k as a penalty( Portia was really rich ) and other compromises but he refuses happily. Since antonio is an important man the Duke himself is the judge and also asks shylock to leave him but in vain.\n\nA random lawyer then arrives there and tells bassanio that portia's lawyer cousin sent him to help them and he also asks shylock to reconsider. After Shylock refuses , the lawyer lectures him about christian mercy, love and that kinda shit yet no difference.\n\nSo she ( the lawyer is portia in disguise dressed as a man unknown to anyone but Nerisca) says ok take the pound of flesh but the agreement doesn't talk blood so take the flesh without shedding any blood. which is impossible so shylock gives up.\n\nThe duke then punishes giving away half his fortune to antonio and the other half to his daughter which he can keep until he dies if he also c onverts .\n\nNow despite sounding like a very anti semantic play it's written with lot of nunace for the era. The hypocrisy of Christians is mocked, shylock also has a dialogue where he speaks says that we ( jews) are hurt by the same weapons, diseases , .... \" If you prick us do we not bleed \" and says that he will treat them the same way they have taught him to."}

Here\u2019s a synopsis of the 112-page novel from Charco:\n\n\u201cOn land where enslaved people were once tortured and murdered, the state built a penal colony in the wilderness, where inmates could be rehabilitated, but never escape. Now, decades later, and having only succeeded in trapping men, not changing them for the better, its operations are winding down. But in the prison\u2019s waning days, a new horror is unleashed: every full-moon night, the inmates are released, the warden is armed with rifles, and the hunt begins. Every man plans his escape, not knowing if his end will come at the hands of a familiar face, or from the unknown dangers beyond the prison walls. Ana Paula Maia has once again delivered a bracing vision of our potential for violence, and our collective failure to account for the consequences of our social and political action, or inaction. No crime is committed out of view for this novelist, and her raw, brutal power enlists us all as witness.\u201d\n\nIn case you were unaware, August is \u201cWomen in Translation Month,\u201d so it really seems like the perfect time to read and discuss this novel as a group!\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking: If you\u2019re interested in participating in this reading group, please plan to acquire and READ the novel (in your preferred language) before Saturday, August 30, on which day we will hold an informal discussion.

{"prompt":"I don't think everyone would love \"The Adventures of Augie March\" but I still want to recommend it here","response":"This was my first experience with Saul Bellow and I can fully understand why he earned a Nobel Prize. \"The Adventures of Augie March\" isn't a novel about anything specific. It's kind of a rambling narrative of a man in his early 30's reflecting on everything he's done so far in life. Sound boring? I can see a perfectly discerning person not enjoying this read. The book doesn't have a clear purpose, most of Augie's philosophy is off the cuff, and there is almost no character development. But it's nonpareil as a lucid character study and if this attracts you in a novel, then please give it a go.\n\nThe novel takes place in the first half of the 20th century in Chicago. Augie himself is the kind of character whose place in our society seems to be shrinking: a true happy-go-lucky person. He doesn't harbor grudges, isn't driven by anything, and is not particularly passionate. He is just a happy young man that gets pulled into the orbit of people who seem to really like him and somehow want to figure them into their own lives. \n\nIf I had read this when I was younger and more depressed I would have hated Augie. I would have resented the aimlessness and cheerful acceptance of almost all of his life circumstances. I would have been jealous of his unusual adventures and the connections he made with so many people. Now, as I get older, I so deeply appreciate him. I want more stories of people who just seem to enjoy life and are having a good time. I loved the richness of the world he created even if it didn't seem to amount to anything.\n\nI think there is something to be said about light-hearted novels. Even though Augie narrates some pretty harrowing experiences and tragedies, it never felt heavy. Maybe it's easy to dismiss the profundity these protagonists for their lack of gravity, but it doesn't make their fictional narratives any less affecting. The way that Bellow managed to realize an almost entirely real person in a book is a master craft, and because he carries it off so well you can sometimes forget how much skill this requires. When you have a character that goes with the flow, you take your own going with the flow in the novel for granted, but really it's a lot of work to carry out this effect.\n\nSo long story short, I want to throw my hat in the ring for this novel. I don't know if it still holds the broad appeal it had at publication, but something about total candidness bridges generations. It's worth a fair try."}

{"prompt":"My take on \u201cStranger\u201d by Albert Camus","response":"I just finished The Stranger and I can\u2019t stop thinking about how cruel the world was to Meursault. Everyone treats him like a monster not because he\u2019s violent or hateful\u2014but because he refuses to fake emotions. He doesn\u2019t cry at his mother\u2019s funeral, he doesn\u2019t say he loves Marie, and he doesn\u2019t pretend to believe in God. For that, society decides he\u2019s inhuman and condemns him.\n\nWhat hit me hardest is how people expect you to perform grief and love in a certain way. If you don\u2019t, they decide you\u2019re evil. But isn\u2019t that its own kind of blindness? Meursault does feel things like when he says, \u201cI wanted to cry because I could feel how much they all hated me.\u201d That line broke me. It shows he\u2019s not emotionless; he\u2019s just detached from the illusions most of us cling to. He\u2019s already accepted that life is meaningless and one day we\u2019ll all die.\n\nThe saddest part is I kept thinking\u2026 if Meursault had been \u201cnormal,\u201d if he\u2019d cried at the funeral or begged for forgiveness, he probably wouldn\u2019t have been sentenced to death. Society wasn\u2019t punishing him for murder they were punishing him for honesty.\n\nBy the end, I didn\u2019t see him as a monster. I saw him as free. He accepts life\u2019s absurdity and finds peace in it. And yet, I still feel bad for him. Because the world was too cruel and too afraid to accept someone like him."}

{"prompt":"My Critique of Camus Premise and Conclusion (Myth of Sisyphus)","response":"I see his premise as a bad example for the message he's trying to convey. He's using the example of Sisyphus who was cursed by zeus to a meaningless unending existence of pointless toil and suffering, and then reframing how sisyphus views this meaningless hell of an existence as rebellion against the absurd or inescapable, which boils down to mind over matter. When in my view, it's a bad example because Sisyphus has no choice to self-delete, ending his torment, but humans do. Staying in the framework the universe and biology (zeus) has forced you into and attempting to carve out some insignificant meaning in the hopelessness of that when all will be corrupted, stolen, and destroyed and it doesn't matter anyway, is an excuse for him not to accept his arrived at conclusion, and I would argue isn't fundamentally possible in an oppressive framework, except in your head. (mind over matter) It seems obvious to me if you're forced by the \"absurd\" into a meaningless existence with only torment and no meaning, continuing on with that isn't rebellion in any sense of the word, just cope and cowardice. Only by eliminating that possibility and escaping the absurd would that be rebellion, an outlook Camus probably considered but didn't like. He peeked behind the curtain, stood on the edge, and decided not to jump. (I'm not advocating for either choice, simply questioning his reasoning and logic.)\n\nHis basic premise is nihilistic, and points to self-deletion as the answer if his framework is true, but he doesn't like it, so argues against it with man-made perceptions of value, instead of at least acknowledging self-deletion as an equal answer to the problem presented given the framework. I guess the fact he sees value or meaning in anything at all, and believes it can be created proves his premise to be incorrect.\n\nI would argue he's asking the wrong question. Asking, to be or not to be? when the real question is what systems exist that are forcing me to weigh one against the other? A meaningless life or a meaningless death? In that question he would see that the absurd that was robbing most of humanity of the true questions and answers was the system that should be rebelled against. Not the universe, not the cosmos, the human systems that rob people of answers until the question is simply, do I stay in this burning building and suffer until I die or do I jump?\n\nIt would seem the poor disproportionately self-delete, and I don't think it's because they think about nihilism, philosophy, or the universe any more than anyone else. The irony in all this is that when people are feeling these emotions which are justifiable given the imposed meaninglessness and lack of true agency or freedom in peoples lives, they are blamed, stigmatized, labelled, and discarded by systems who claim can help them, claim can save them, then don't but can say they tried. Then claim there's no problem, just crazy people. Everything in society is designed to point people to a non-existent \"solution\" presented by the source of most of their existential problems.\n\nIt's not that life is meaningless, just that we've been robbed of the mechanism, humanity, and agency that gives most human life meaning, and we've done it so long we blame the people feeling the effects the most and refuse to change. It's that aspect of Camus analogy that I reject, we're not rebelling against some cosmic \"absurd\" but against our own \"absurd\" systems and our willingness to go along with them because most humans don't want freedom, agency, or truth, they want the path of least resistance, and comfortable lies which never lead anywhere good. I know there's inconsistencies in all literature. but particularly for anyone who tends towards nihilism and are asking questions about self-deletion, if they look under the hood of his reasoning, they won't be satisfied, and may even feel more inclined to lean towards self-deletion.\n\nI'm just saying if you accept the premise that all life is inherently meaningless and you're forced into an existence akin to unending torment or hell, true rebellion would be escaping that situation, not faking a smile. I believe life has meaning and the fact we are looking for it, and Camus answer seems to imply it can be created shows that, he himself believed in meaning and that it's possible, but until we destroy the systems and frameworks that force us to push a boulder up a mountain for no reason, and philosophies that tell us to pretend to like it, we're not going to find much, and people are going to \"opt\" out."}
{"prompt":"My Critique of Camus Premise and Conclusion (Myth of Sisyphus)","response":"tldr?"}
{"prompt":"Is this a reasonable argument?","response":"So, my friend and I were arguing about which book has better writing. He claimed the one he likes is\u00a0**objectively**\u00a0better because of its character development, worldbuilding, etc. I disagreed, I asked, \u201c*According to who?*\u201d Because fans of the other book would say the same things about\u00a0*t*heir preference.\n\nI think calling something \"good writing\" is always going to be subjective it depends entirely on personal taste. But when we're talking about what makes something\u00a0**better writing**, then we need some kind of measurable standard. For me, that standard is how many people the writing reaches, which is reflected in things like book sales or readership.\n\nThe goal of writing, especially in fiction, is to be read, enjoyed, and shared. So if one book or series has reached hundreds of millions more people than another, that says something important about the effectiveness of its writing in terms of engagement and impact.\n\nSome might argue that \"better writing\" is about character development or worldbuilding. But those are also based on individual preference. For example, some people enjoy stories where the main character is already powerful and doesn\u2019t change much, while others prefer stories about gradual growth and struggle like Saitama and Goku for example. Neither of those is objectively better they\u2019re just different styles.\n\nIf we\u2019re comparing two works from\u00a0**the same genre**, it becomes more fair to judge them side by side. That's because they're operating within the same general expectations, themes, and audience size. But comparing across different genres like mystery vs. fantasy isn\u2019t objective, because different genres attract different types and sizes of audiences. One genre might naturally have a smaller but dedicated following, while another appeals to a broader audience.\n\nSo if two works are from the same genre and are both widely available and accessible, I think it's fair to say that the one with significantly higher sales or cultural reach can reasonably be considered the more impactful or effective piece of writing even if not everyone personally prefers it.\n\nSo what do you guys think?"}

{"prompt":"Any writers who have shocked you with their talent and work ethic?","response":"My one is Philip Roth. He is so psychologically realistic in his writing that I was blown away how lifelike his characters were. A few examples being the Plot against America, the child character\u2019s reaction to trauma is so realistic. I\u2019ve observed similar patterns in real life. Every character in the book reacts like how a real person would.\n\nThe mother character in \u201cPortnoys Complaint\u201d is one of the most hilarious and terrifying women ever put down on page. At various stages I was in tears laughing but also blown away about how psychologically deep she was. Think Larry David\u2019s parents x100.

Otherwise, don't put it there\". I think this quote reflects it perfectly. No author would go lengths to plan out everything and spend so much time just for others to dismiss it as not being deep. It is that deep, you just lack the thinking capability to understand the depth. Everything in the book is there for a reason. \"oh the author mentioned the door is red, it just means it's red, it doesn't serve any purpose\" yes it does. It's either to create mood or create a subconscious feeling, or it has some significance to the story, or the author included it as part of some reference or quirk. It's not there for nothing. If its there, it has some meaning and its YOUR job to analyze it not complain about it being included without irrelevance. Even if the author just meant the door is red, stuff like this can be used to analyze the author himself rather than the text.\nIts never \"not deep\" because this type of thinking is how we fall prey to propaganda, and lose critical thinking.\nThis is not about english teachers, I wanted to talk about people dismissing text because its not deep."}

And made made realize something I never thought about before..............\n\nThat far more people know about the god and goddesses of Olympias and the heroes of the Illiad and the Oyddssey  along with Perseus and Jason's quest for the Golden fleece than any other mythology foreign to their own cultures in the world. As seen with Saint Seiya and other popular media made in other nations, far more movies, video games, live theatre, and TV shows have been made on Hellenic  stories than any other countries (except for native mythic literature of non-Christian counties ass seen with Shinto Japan and even then non-Christians are far more likely to use Greek mythology than other foreign sagas and legends if they create a story in the myths retelling genre).\n\nThat for Christian countries is even the presence is even more in-grained in popular consciousness because so many people in converted places like Mexico, Philippines, and Lebanon don't know any folklore stuff thats unrelated to Christianity esp predating their pre-current predominant Abrahamic religions yet at least the most famous Greek gods and goddesses can be named by the general public in now Christian countries. \n\nThis is esp true in Europe where not only a modern retellings of the ancient stories in novels, TV, interactive tabletop experiences, comics, animation, cinema, and computer games are published all the time but **its required reading in the college level**. That even for the few countries in the continent where the general populace still has some vague awareness of their pre-Abrahamic mythos such as Sweden with the Norse stories, they'd still get more exposure to Hellenic Polytheism just by classes from post-secondary education having assignments as prerequisites towards the path to your major. That unless they take specific classes or gear towards a specific major that primarily focuses on pre-modern history or classical literature of their culture, even people from places that kept the memory of local pre-Christian myths  will end up knowing more about the Hellenic figures than they do about their own local gods. As seen in Germany despite the presence of Siegfried's Cycle in high culture and mass media, more educated people know more tidbits about say Athena than the specificity of trivia of Siegfried himself. \n\nSo I'm wondering why is this the case? How come for example Beowulf never became a globally famous name despite the presence of the British empire as the largest civilization in history? Or why aren't there much retelling of Siegfried outside of Germany and Austria even withing Europe despite being the icon of the DACH and the fame of Wagner's Opera in the theatre world?

{"prompt":"Any advice on developing better reading strategies?","response":"As a child, I considered myself a big reader. I\u2019d bring dozens of books with me every time I went on a vacation with my family, and I was proud of myself for this. Granted, those books were usually DK textbooks or Carl Hiaasen\u2019s Young-reader novels, but I think that's to be expected of a 10-year-old boy. I stopped reading for pleasure, on my own, during COVID and my early teenage years for the most part; aside from 2023 and the spring of 2024, when I made an effort to try to read as much \u201cserious literature (and non-fiction) as I could (which, while I was able to read classics I enjoyed like *Jane Eyre* and *We*, did result in me mismanaging my time to the point my grades in school tanked), I haven't read much of anything outside of stuff I was assigned in school.\n\n\nI graduated from high school two weeks ago, and, now as an adult, I want to make an effort to bring reading, at least fiction, back into my life now that I probably won't have any obligation to do so like I did in my AP Literature class; otherwise I'm afraid I wont read at all.\n\n\nMy concerns are two-fold:\n\nFor one, the fact that for several years now I have read books as if they were a chore, even if I was doing it voluntarily (while its not fiction, EP Thompson\u2019s *The Making of the English Working Class* felt like this), has severely hampered my ability to enjoy the act of reading itself. Several times since 2024 I've tried reading a book (*Beloved*, *The Castle*, *The Dispossessd* *It Can\u2019t Happen Here*, etc) only to give up before finishing it, sometimes after only trying to go read it for a few one-to-hour sessions because I got bored and disinterested, and I hate that. It makes me self-loathing in the way that I've become so used to instant gratification due to (and I know I sound like one of those cringeworthy old people on Facebook, but I genuinely believe this) my phone, that I can no longer find joy or the will to engage in an activity I used to cherish when I was little. I feel that the 10-year-old might be a bit ashamed of the person I've become because of this, and I hate that. I want to get back into reading, but I don't want it to feel like a chore, and I want to be able to finish something without giving up on reading it.\n\nThe 2nd is related to my comprehension. I tried reading Kafka\u2019s *The Judgment* today, but upon I ended up barely reading and comprehending it, probably because my mind wasn't focused on it (I wasn't in the location I am when I usually try to read: my local library) and I got lost in my thoughts partially; but the fact I read something yet didn't comprehend what I was reading beyond the general gist of the text didn't sit right with me.\n\nEven when I do focus on comprehending what I'm reading, I feel my reading of the work is entirely superficial (my experience reading *We, *The Metamorphosis*, and especially any poems that weren\u2019t *Oh Captain, My Captain* felt like this); if you've seen the meme or the ogre beating himself up over his comprehension of the themes in *Ulysses*, that's what I'm getting at (even if I haven't, nor likely will ever, try reading Joyce at this rate). It\u2019s very frustrating to me.\n\nI want to be able to read deep into classic books and create insightful interpretations of them as if I had a tenth the critical insight of a Walter Benjamin. I want to actually read the novels of the recent Nobel laureates and booker prize winners for fun. But at this point I'm lost at where to begin now that I don't have an obligation to read and my reading ability seems to have been broken. \n\nAre there any reading strategies that have helped you all, if you were once in a similar position as me? I already have an idea of what I'm going to read first, I'd just like help with strategies on **how** to read it."}

{"prompt":"Howards End","response":"This is my first Forster, and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll be back for more. \n\nI wonder, for those who have read it, what do you think of Margaret\u2019s journey? For a large part of the novel you watch her transform herself. Though it feels like the core of who she is remains, she is holding her breath and her tongue most of the time.\n\nWhen she is ultimately impelled to act in greater accordance with who she is and her values, you can feel her throw off restraints\/constraints and *breathe*. **But who is she in the end?** It\u2019s almost like this final version of Margaret is more concealed from us than the earlier versions were. For that matter, is a Henry broken in the end, or has he evolved? \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure *A Passage to India* and *Maurice* are next on my list."}

{"prompt":"Just finished the Clifton Chronicles \u2014 here are my thoughts. Do you all feel the same?","response":"I recently wrapped up The Clifton Chronicles and while I genuinely enjoyed the overall journey, I now see it with more clarity \u2014 especially after reflecting on all seven books.\n\nThe first three books were absolutely excellent. The character arcs of Harry, Emma, and Giles felt natural, emotionally rich, and truly character-driven. Their struggles, ambition, and class divides made for compelling storytelling.\n\nFrom book four onward, I felt the series gradually became more plot-stretched. The business angles and Sebastian\u2019s early arc with Samantha were still good, but many storylines started feeling manufactured. For example, Samantha\u2019s sudden exit felt unjustified and forced. And from this point, Harry as a central character faded, with more focus shifting to Giles, Emma, and especially Sebastian.\n\nBy the time I reached books six and seven, the quality dropped for me. The Priya arc in book six was beautifully built up \u2014 only to be abruptly ended without any proper emotional follow-up. That genuinely frustrated me. And in the last book, I was overwhelmed by how much space was given to Virginia Fenwick \u2014 to the point that it overshadowed the core cast. Her arc, and especially her ending, didn\u2019t feel earned.\n\nAlso, the heavy exposition in the later books took away from the earlier charm of Archer\u2019s smoother storytelling. I still read on because of the emotional attachment and need for closure \u2014 but in hindsight, the final three books didn\u2019t feel as rewarding.\n\nStill, I don\u2019t regret reading them. Archer\u2019s style, especially early on, is so readable and compelling that you just keep going. But now I understand why many on Reddit are more mixed about the series.\n\nCurious \u2014 did anyone else feel this shift in tone and quality? Or did you experience it differently? Would love to hear your thoughts!"}
{"prompt":"A Night with Tolstoy and Wordsworth and the Morning That Followed","response":"Last night under the soft lamp glow I picked up Lines Written a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey by William Wordsworth in my lap. He spoke of returning to the river Wye, of finding not just beauty but a kind of inner companionship in nature and I felt something loosen in me. \n\nThese beauteous forms have not been to me\nas is a landscape to a blind man\u2019s eye. But oft, in lonely rooms and \u2019mid the din of towns and cities, I have owed to them sensations sweet. \n\nTherefore am I still a lover of the meadows and the woods, and mountains and of all that we behold from this green earth. \n\nI could feel his reverence for the natural world wrapping around me like an old quilt. Because I too have walked in and out of places, gardens, verandahs, kitchen doorways glowing in the late afternoon never knowing they would return one day to save me. That they would become internal sanctuaries, revisited not by foot but by need. Wordsworth knew this that even when we\u2019re far from nature, her memory travels with us, as medicine as anchor. \n\nThen I turned to Tolstoy\u2019s Family Happiness. His words were simpler, quieter like warm hands smoothing out a wrinkled thought. They spoke in the language of firelight and shared bread. And then I read this line quietly devastating in it\u2019s truth: \n\nThat is where true happiness lies, In the old simplicity, the small circle of duties, the garden, the children, the evening by the fire. \n\nI reread it three times. I felt it more than I read it. Because isn\u2019t that everything? The essence we\u2019re all chasing but rarely name. Not ambition. Not noise. Just the soft unfolding of ordinary love. A life measured not by milestones but by moments. \n\nThen I must\u2019ve fallen asleep somewhere in that space between Wordsworth\u2019s quiet river and Tolstoy\u2019s flickering hearth, with the book still open beside me. I fell asleep somewhere between the garden and the river and the pages I\u2019d read must\u2019ve rearranged something in me while I rested.\n\nThis morning I woke before the alarms. I didn\u2019t just wake up. I emerged as if from a deeper place. There was only the faint birdcall and a breeze through the half open window. The Sunday morning light crept through the curtains like a hymn. And inside Wordsworth\u2019s river still ran through me. Tolstoy\u2019s fire still flickered low. And between them some unnamed part of me had been rewoven in the night. \n\nA strange but beautiful thing happens when you let literature seep into your sleep. In the way two writers from another time can reach across centuries to remind you what home really means. You wake not just rested but recalibrated. The kind of rest that isn\u2019t just of the body, but of the soul.\n\nSo I just lay there full of a softness just feeling the way those old sentences had carved out peace inside me. And perhaps the richest thing we can ever be is simply at peace. Would love to hear if anyone else has ever had a book that stayed with them through sleep."}

{"prompt":"Dostoevsky greatly influenced this Argentinian writer! \u2014 Have you read Antonio Di Benedetto? \u2014 Zama (1956) and the \u201cTrilogy of Expectation\u201d","response":"Firstly, if you\u2019re at all interested in further discussing Latin American literature at large, please join r\/latamlit today!\n\nDi Benedetto\u2019s novels *Zama* (1956), *The Silentiary* (1964), and *The Suicides* (1969) comprise a loose trilogy of sorts known as the \u201cTrilogy of Expectation.\u201d Has anyone here read any or all of these books?\n\nPersonally, I just finished *Zama* and am very excited to dive into the rest of the trilogy!\n\nFor me, Di Benedetto\u2019s prose in *Zama* felt rather akin to Dostoevsky\u2019s *Notes from Underground* in terms of tone, themes, and narrative voice, which makes a lot of sense considering the Argentinian often cited the Russian as a primary influence. To be frank, I say this with the caveat that I\u2019m no expert in Dostoevsky, so here\u2019s a backup quote from Dustin Illingworth in *The Nation* magazine:\n\n\u201cThe frustrated narrators of the Argentine writer Antonio Di Benedetto occupy a unique vantage in mid-20th-century fiction. Blending the futility of Kafka\u2019s surveyors with the inner turmoil of Dostoyevsky\u2019s underground men, Di Benedetto\u2019s martyrs of deferment await a deliverance that never comes. Their lives\u2014inert, almost parenthetical\u2014offer up the psychological extremity of stasis. Madness, obsession, and terminal lassitude hang in equipoise from his subtle systems of narrative suspension.\u201d\n\nFor me, Di Benedetto\u2019s style tends to border on the baroque in *Zama* but with purpose, as it works towards the aesthetic and thematic ends of the novel; at the same time, I found his writing to be very rhythmical and entrancing, and some of the metaphors and turns of phrase that he employed to be outright exhilarating!\n\nThough Di Benedetto drew much inspiration from Dostoevsky, he also imparted significant inspiration himself, particularly on Roberto Bola\u00f1o, who was not shy about his Argentinian predecessor\u2019s influence on his own writing. In fact, Bola\u00f1o\u2019s short story \u201cSensini\u201d is a thinly veiled representation of Di Benedetto\u2026 So, I guess I\u2019m going to reread that piece in Spanish ASAP with a fresh set of eyes!\n\n(Side note: Lucrecia Martel\u2019s 2017 film *Zama* is a an excellent adaptation of the novel!)"}

It is what we are and what we choose not to be.\n\n[Pandemic Community Poem published by Muse-Pie Press](http:\/\/musepiepress.com\/pandemic.html)"}
